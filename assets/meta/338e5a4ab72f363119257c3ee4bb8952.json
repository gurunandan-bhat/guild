	"overview": "Khalid, a 5th standard student is teased by his classmates because of his religion after a chapter on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was being studied. \"Why do the children tease me by the name of Afzal Khan? Just because I am a Muslim? Was every Muslim an enemy of Shivaji Maharaj like Afzal Khan?\" Khalid's curiousity and fascination with Shivaji Maharaj sends him and his family on a life-altering journey.",
