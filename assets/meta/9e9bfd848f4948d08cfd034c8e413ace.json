	"overview": "'Mithya' is a journey alongside Mithun, an eleven-year-old, coming to terms with the sudden loss of his parents. Things turn gloomier as their families squabble over his custody, even as questions over the nature of his Father's death remain unanswered. We walk in step with Mithun/Mithya's tottering feet, as they search for solid ground. Can a new house be home, can friendships be forged again or is it all just a search for something long gone?",
