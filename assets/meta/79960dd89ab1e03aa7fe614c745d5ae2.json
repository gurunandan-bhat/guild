	"overview": "Based on the novel ‘Teerthatan Ke Baad’ by Amrik Singh Deep, the film set in the 1980s in the serene state of Uttarakhand tells the story of a woman who rebuilds herself after years of being in an abusive marriage when she starts talking to an empathetic writer through letters. Harshita gets a second chance after the death of her husband when she meets Sridhar, a writer, who treats her with kindness and respect. The film brings out the conflict surrounding such relationships and is an ode to love and the power it holds to transform someone’s life. It explores how abuse is common, accepted and normalised within patriarchy, leaving a deep shattering impact on womanhood. It delves into how love holds the power to liberate anyone who is subjugated to abuse with a message to liberate and empower women.",
