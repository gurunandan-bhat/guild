A show on a mafia family who begin plotting against each other or another that investigates the lives and trials of honest police officers. A series that delves deep into the pre-IIT prep sweat shops or one where a young man learns the quirks of living in a small town. The thriving digital space in India has something for everyone. Comedians, directors, writers, and box office ruling actors have all joined this territory for its promise. Currently, series and short films aren’t considered stepping stones anymore, they are a strong foundation to a space that is the new rage.

This year, India’s most credible film critics, in partnership with Motion Content Group, laud the inventiveness of this growing medium through the Critics’ Choice Awards. In our first edition, the awards recognized short films, in the second we enhanced the awards to include the exciting and burgeoning space of web series and episodic content. This year we aim to continue unearthing and honoring talent from this flourishing space. With a transparent process to identify worthy winners, these awards aim to reward the immense creativity of this industry.

The Awards show took place virtually on 14th February, 2021.
