Since 2018, the Film Critics Guild and Motion Content Group in collaboration with Vistas Media Capital have persevered to showcase, recognise and reward the best stories coming out of India's burgeoning content landscape. Our aim has unswervingly remained the championing of short films, web series and feature films all on the same platform across all Indian languages, through an unbiased, credible, transparent process that lauds merit, talent and creativity above all else.

The Film Critics Guild Critics Choice Awards for 2024 follow.
