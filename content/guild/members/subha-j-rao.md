Subha J Rao has loved the movies since she sat in a darkened makeshift auditorium as a child and watched a K Balachander classic come alive on a white cloth that doubled up as screen. A journalist with over 28 years of experience, she has worked in The Indian Express and United News of India, New Delhi, from 1997 to 2002. She then joined The Hindu and had two stints there, from November 2002 to May 2017. She lives in Mangaluru, Karnataka, and you can catch her on Friday mornings reviewing Tamil and Kannada films with her handbag for company. She specialises in interviews, and loves to bring alive the person behind the personality.

She currently writes for The News Minute, OTT Play, The Federal, The Hollywood Reporter India and The Hindu. She is a recipient of two Laadli Media and Advertising Awards (Regional and National) for the year 2025 for her gender-sensitive writing.
