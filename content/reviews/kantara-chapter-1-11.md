There are films that end with closure, films that end with questions. And then there’s Kantara: Chapter 1, which ends with a divine tiger, a scheming princess, a possessed king, and Rishab Shetty turning into a ball of fire before shapeshifting into a goddess’s wrath. Yes, subtlety packed its bags early in this movie. And chances are you walked out of the theatre blinking and muttering, “Wait, what just happened?”
