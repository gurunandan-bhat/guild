This is the end  
Hold your breath and count to ten  
Feel the earth move and then  
Hear my heart burst again  
For this is the end  
I've drowned and dreamt this moment  
So overdue, I owe them  
Swept away, I'm stolen.  
You may wonder — as you should — why a review of a Mission: Impossible film begins with a Bond theme song. Adele's famous lines for Skyfall, every word of it true for what is said to be the final M:I film, were playing in my head as I walked in to watch The Final Reckoning. When I came out close to three hours later, my mind silently screamed: 'This CANNOT be the end'.
