The film is being raved for one of the best adaptations in the recent years, and for good measure. Even with the additional content added to the runtime, great VFX/CGI, and the impeccable IMAX transitions, the film still have much more to offer. The live action does not stray from the original in terms on concept, context or plot, but it adds more to the lore and the emotional range of the characters, including the dragons. Toothless and the other four legged stars all get moments to shine, but the musical score, not so much. How To Train Your Dragon begins with its iconic monologue about Berk and its perks. Hiccup leads his way to the swordsmith's store right after a Dragon attack on the village. In his path he leaves behind a lot of destruction not for the dragons but his own people. Despite everyone warning him to get inside, Hiccup takes his design to catch a Night Fury all by himself, but again ends up with destruction in his path. While he does hit something in the dark of the night, body is ready to belive him that its a Night Fury, even worse his father, the Chief of the village completely gives up on him and gets out to find the dragon's nest with the rest of the village.
