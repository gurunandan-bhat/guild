It has been nearly 3 decades since Tom Cruise suspended himself from the ceiling inside a CIA vault and stole classified data of the US government from a computer. That set the stage for death-defying stunts in subsequent films in the franchise. As Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, and hangs from a plane, fighting his opponent and nemesis Gabriel while defying gravity, one wonders if the tried and tested template of the MI series is finally wearing off. The 8th and presumably the final in the series, Mission: Impossible- The Final Reckoning, picks up from where Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One ended. AI and its threat to world peace loom large and Ethan Hunt is beckoned by the US President to come and save the world. Entity - the villainous Artificial Intelligence, threatens to encrypt the data system of Nuclear-empowered countries across the world and detonate bombs across the world, which can start World War III and erase mankind. It is up to Ethan to find a solution and save the world in a matter of four days.
