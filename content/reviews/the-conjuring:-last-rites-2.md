Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are enjoying retirement, until a chilling case in a remote Pennsylvania home draws them back into the darkness. The haunting isn’t just another possession… it has a terrifying link to their daughter, Judy (Mia Tomlinson). The fourth movie in the Conjuring universe, also touted as the finale, is a slowburn horror that burns a bit too slow. It stays loyal to the Conjuring template— big family in a haunted house, creepy attic, and eerie musical toys delivering solid jump scares—but it takes far too long to get to the point. Overloaded with ambition, the uneven pacing may not rob its tension, but it makes the experience more exhausting than terrifying. At 2 hours and 15 minutes, the final instalment feels bogged down by its heavy-handed emotional drama. Overstuffed, this time around the demonic spirits haunt not just one home but two -- the Warrens and the Smurl family. The story shuttles between these two parallel tracks until they converge in an extended climax. The fear element persists but it gets overshadowed by the family drama.
