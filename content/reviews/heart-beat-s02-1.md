Radhi resigns from her job, seeking solace at home, while Reena, promoted as a senior resident, clashes with Arjun, now a CEO. A new batch of interns arrives as Teju, working in a modest clinic, refuses to forgive Naveen. Madan contemplates suicide amidst mounting financial woes. The new in-charge, Preetham, assigns Reena a high-profile case with ulterior motives. Anumol is the glue that keeps the soul of the show intact, using her strong screen presence and maturity in handling even clich√©d situations with ease. Deepa Balu has a vibrant persona, so does Yogalakshmi. Charukesh, Amit Bhargav, Sharmila Thapa, Padine Kumar, Sarvhaa, RG Ram and other actors in the hospital gang hold the fort with natural, spontaneous performances.
