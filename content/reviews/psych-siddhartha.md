There’s something disarming about a first-time filmmaker’s eagerness to break free of established norms of storytelling. Architect-turned-filmmaker Varun Reddy’s Telugu film Psych Siddhartha is a case in point. Varun, who has written and co-produced the film with actor Shree Nandu, presents a fairly simple relationship drama like a comic book for adults, wanting to speak the language of Gen Z. The film may not be perfect but ushers in a promising voice that’s eager to push the boundaries of storytelling.
