Falling back on the done-to-death down Agatha Christie template of a rich man's mansion, one murdered dude and multiple suspects opening the way for a maverick detective to solve the mystery, Detective Sherdil's bag of twists and tricks have little intrigue and zero cunning. But the silliness it packs in the guise of humour not only trivialises a likeable star but squanders its ensemble cast into one-note distractions. Its stale and dull suspense, set in Budapest for visual novelty, kickstarts when a moneybags (Boman Irani) is brutally bumped off, setting the stage for Sherdil -- a blend of Sherlock-meets-Karamchand-meets Byomkesh, strictly by his own standards -- to crack the case concerning muddled inheritance and greedy claimants.
