Abhishek’s career is at risk with a case lodged against him, entangled in a political power struggle involving Pradhan and Bhushan. As Pradhan recovers from a murder attempt and launches his election campaign, Bhushan’s camp makes preemptive strikes and tries to break Pradhan’s loyalists. The election intensifies with family visits, campaign altercations, and a pre-election power outage. Jitendra Kumar’s portrayal of Abhishek’s evolution, from a shy urban lad to a stubborn officer who knows his village inside out, is both entertaining and relatable. By now, he’s too aware of the game to commit any folly. Veterans Raghubir Yadav and Neena Gupta deliver top-class performances as the village’s power couple, staying true to the spirit of their cheeky characters.
