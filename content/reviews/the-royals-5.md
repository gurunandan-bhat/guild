Netflix’s new web series The Royals- featuring Bhumi Pednekar and Ishaan Khatter- holds a lot of potential. In a crime thriller-infested OTT space, light-hearted romantic comedies are a win-win, particularly at a time when there is so much despair outside the screen otherwise. One would ideally want to sit back, grab a bucket of popcorn or a tub of ice cream, and binge-watch the slow-burning romance between Ishaan and Bhumi on the show. The Royals, after all, is a story of a reluctant prince and a go-getter self-made woman- they look good, they have smoldering chemistry, and the locations are fabulous- all serving as a perfect ingredient for a feel-good romance drama. Yet creator Rangita Pritish Nandy’s The Royals falters too much, making the premise of the whole show feel too superfluous and lame to be taken seriously.
