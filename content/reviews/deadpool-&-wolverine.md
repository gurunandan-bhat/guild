In Deadpool & Wolverine—the new superhero movie that ushers both title characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe—Deadpool is obsessed with doing something worthwhile. He wants to matter and serve a higher purpose. And he does, for Marvel Studios has pinned all its 2024 hopes on a foul-mouthed wisecracking guy it had no hand in creating. In fact, this is the only MCU movie in a 15-month period. Talk about timing. Deadpool wasn’t part of Marvel’s gargantuan, all-consuming shared world until its parent company, Disney, forked over $70 billion a few years ago and ate up one of its Hollywood rivals, Fox. For a Deadpool concerned with his place, this is like being handed two gold-plated .50 calibre Desert Eagle pistols on a silver platter.
