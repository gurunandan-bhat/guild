A pamphlet from the Kerala Tourism department will mention

- Elephants
- Kalaripayattu
- Boat races
- Coconut trees
- Lungis
- Banana leaf meals
- Mohini Attam

Why director Tushar Jalota needed co-writers Gaurav Mishra and Aarsh Vora to tell the story of billionaire baap ka beta Param Sachdev (Sidharth Malhotra) and Sundari (Janhvi Kapoor) is curious for it doesn’t go beyond the tourism pamphlets of the scenic state. Ah, yes, what the pamphlets miss and Jalota gets is that God’s own country is unwelcoming of guests, calls their shorts chaddis and insists on a lungi. It’s called fun, in Jalota language. In a shrinking world where barriers between the North and the South have come down, alongside tech talk like apps, AI and algorithms, Jalota flies the Punjabi munda to Kerala who gapes at its culture and its people like he’s in a different galaxy. Param has used a new app to find his soulmate and there she is doing the Mohini Attam in her home stay. Soon, Sundari must give him the mandatory dressing down on how Kerala is different from Tamil Nadu like he’s been living in a North Indian cave.
