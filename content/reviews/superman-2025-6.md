Following the release of Man of Steel (2013) and the critically panned Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), which failed to perform well at the box office, the Kryptonian superhero was granted a hiatus. This film has been in the works for some time; however, when Justice League (2017) encountered production difficulties, the sequel to Man of Steel was also sidelined. James Gunn, who directed the three Guardians of the Galaxy films for Marvel, has transitioned to D.C. with this new Superman project. Although Guardians franchise featured a team of superheroes while this one primarily focuses on a solo hero (with the Justice gang making a brief appearance), there is a significant difference in the tone of the two movies. Guardians was predominantly a light-hearted film that utilized humor to navigate its narrative, whereas Superman does not follow the same pattern. He faces a serious mission to thwart the nefarious schemes of Lex Luthor. With Lois Lane present, there is an opportunity to incorporate some romantic elements, and some of the most delightful moments arise from Krypto, the Superdog. . But otherwise, Superman plays it by the numbers.
