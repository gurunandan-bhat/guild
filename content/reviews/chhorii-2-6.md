Seven years after the events of Chhorii, Sakshi (Nushrratt Bharrucha) is happily staying with her daughter Ishani (Hardika Das). The 7-year-old girl suffers from a rare condition where she gets instantly burnt in the sun and so, darkness is her ally. She’s either at home or covered top to bottom when stepping out. But one fateful night, revenge and vengeance claw their way into their happy little world. The mother-daughter duo is now back in the same cursed village and sugarcane fields they once fled. They are trapped in a cave where there’s an Adimanav, who feeds on ‘seva’ and ‘samarpan’ from young girls, a Daasi maa (Soha Ali Khan) who aides the caveman in his ‘healing’ quest, young and old torchbearers of toxic misogyny, and corpses gunning for revenge, among other elements. What primarily worked for Chhorii when it released in 2021 was that it balanced the chills and thrills with its messaging about female infanticide. But the sequel fails to do just that. The weight of its social commentary is unfortunately borne by its thrills - that rarely get you to the edge of your seat. The supernatural characters, too, fail to evoke any horrors.
