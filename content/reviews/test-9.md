Directed by co-written by S. Sashikanth, the Netflix film is about love, passion and determination. It brings together inherently different people who are fueled by different emotions. Led by R. Madhavan, Nayanthara, and Siddharth, the film follows all three as their stories entangle the most important days of their lives. Their decisions at that moment will define who they are and who they are willing to be. While the performances are good in several moments, the story does not bring a complete journey for either of the characters. The film begins with Arjun, a celebrated cricketer who is about to be kicked off the national team. But his passion for the game has him twisted enough to manipulate the team management, even if it includes the media harassing his wife and his kid. It also leads to his father's poor health, social media trolling. Things work out for him as he is confirmed to play in the next tournament with Pakistan.
