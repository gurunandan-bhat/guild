The genial but crafty lawyer Madhav Mishra, played by Pankaj Tripathi, is back for yet another legal conundrum that doesn't test much of his intelligence. Instead, this new murder involving a couple and a mistress has many confounding twists that don't leave the desired impact. Directed by Rohan Sippy, the crime thriller Criminal Justice - A Family Matter will keep you interested in the final outcome, but the excitement levels have dimmed with the formulaic treatment of the show. The fourth season is focused on the Nagpals, a separated husband and wife couple, Raj (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub) and Anju (Surveen Chawla). Raj is accused of murdering Roshni Saluja (Asha Negi), the caretaker of their 13-year-old daughter Ira (Khushi Bhardwaj), and later Anju is roped in as a potential suspect. It's up to Madhav Mishra and his ace team to stop his client from spending their life in jail. Will the defence be able to prove their case over the police and prosecutor's evidence? The answers seem pretty obvious.
