He is 42. Single. Still a virgin. He is Shrirenu Tripathi (R Madhavan), he teaches Sanskrit in Jamshedpur. Even his students tease him about virginal bachelorhood. She is Madhu Bose (Fatima Sana Shaikh), she teaches French in Kolkata. She’s dumped Namit (Karan Wahi), her ex, after he checked out if she’s a virgin. Shrirenu chats on Aap Jaisa Koi, an app for cosy, sexual conversations between strangers. The voice on the other end of the app tells him he’s a cross between Gulzar and George Clooney. He goes all moony-eyed. With a forgettable song in the background. Until Srirenu meets Madhu. The sparks are perfect. They like the same sort of tea with milk and elaichi. She even preferred Ashok Kumar to Kishore Kumar. Oldies are just fine for her. He is old-fashioned, still believes in flowers pressed into books. And he talks to a mouse in a trap.
