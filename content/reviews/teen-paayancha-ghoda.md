Teen Paayancha Ghoda (English title: Three Legged Horse) takes place in 2003 in Pune. Adnan (Kunal Shukla), a carefree youngster, has been flunking his 12th standard exams. He has already lost two years in the process. His girlfriend Chandrika (Ria Nalavade), who is even more carefree, continues to support him despite his failure. Adnan’s father is in the rehabilitation centre for alcoholism. He isn’t strict with Adnan and doesn’t have any grudges for him failing in exams. But Adnan’s nana (Gajanan Paranjpe), who is a retired IPS (Indian Police Service) officer and with him he lives, is super strict and has given an ultimatum to him to pass his exams this year.
