Filmmaking can be incredibly complex but sometimes, all you need are two beautiful people who light up the screen together. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are proof. On The Fall Guy—the new action comedy mystery romance movie from Deadpool 2 director David Leitch—the two showcase movie star charisma from the moment we first lay eyes on them. You can’t help but fall in love. They share incredible chemistry, the kind that pulls you into the film and makes you forget everything. Their mutual magnetism is so powerful that you’re always looking forward to the next time they will be in the same frame whenever they are not. The back and forth between them goes down so smoothly—it helps that Gosling has excellent comedic timing, as everyone saw in last year’s Barbie.
