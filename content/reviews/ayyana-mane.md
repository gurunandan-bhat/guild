Jaaji gets married to Dushyanta, the youngest son in a joint family that’s guarding a mystery, in return for a 5-acre property. Right on the day she enters her in-laws’ house, her father-in-law is found dead. Her brother-in-law Mahesha has strange visions about his ex-wife Pushpavati. Over time, Jaaji realises that the house harbours secrets that could destroy her peace. The show largely rests on Kushee Ravi’s steady shoulders. She carries the drama with a convincing performance as a confused daughter-in-law trying to uncover the secrets of a strange and eerie family. It’s clear she has grown as an actor since her Dia days, and it’s heartening to see a new side to her talent. Manasi Sudhir also stands out, bringing strength and a strong screen presence to her role.
