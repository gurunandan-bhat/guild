Songs of Paradise is written and directed by Danish Renzu, stars Saba Azad and Soni Razdan as the leading character of Zeba aka Noor Begum. The film is inspired by the life and the songs of Kashmir’s legendary singer, Raj Begum (1927-2016). The film explores her story with bravery, which she showed at a time when women’s basic rights were limited and opportunities in the arts were scarce. Named as Noor Begum in the film, she is seen being the change she hoped for and paving the way for more freedom and talent for the women of Kashmir. The film begins with Soni Razdan as Noor Begum discussing the rights for her team and artists while renewing her own contract with the station. Strict with her rules and the expectations for her young students, Noor Begum lives up to the name and legacy she created on her own. Meanwhile, a young boy from Mumbai comes to visit her to learn of her story, but, unsure of his intentions, Noor Begum refuses to talk to him.
