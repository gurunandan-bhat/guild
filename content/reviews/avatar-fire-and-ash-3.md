At over three hours, it is certainly the longest edition so far. And, as James Cameron watchers would expect from the writer-director, the scale of the new Na’vi adventure is visually stunning. In the fight between the water people (in tune with Nature) and the air people (expansionist humans), a new fire people enter the fray. In short, all the elements in different avatars. The fire people are grotesque and non-believing to boot. Nature has to win.
