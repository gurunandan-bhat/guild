It’s laughable at first, like the main actors are caricatures. Curiously named Sophia Kanmani Shekhar (Bhumi Pednekar), the award-winning entrepreneur shows the middle finger to VIPs. Especially those that come riding a horse shirtless on a Sri Lankan beach. The Shirtless Sultan as Aviraaj (Ishaan Khatter) is later crowned, show creator Neha Sharma and directors Priyanka Ghose and Nupur Asthana labour at taking his shirt off to show a royal six-pack in swimming pools, during photo shoots and atop a horse. There’s equal effort put in to have Sophia-Aviraaj grab each other, smooch, grope, grow apart, a dozen times. VIP-hating Sophia, as confused as her name, has conceived Royal B & B, her own genius business model to have blue blood mingle with hoi polloi. An early taste of she-doesn’t-know-where-she’s-at: an encounter with same middle finger VIP at a bar. The next moment, they’re smooching in a room, ready for action. Only to end up calling each other names and to pull out saying, it was a mistake.
