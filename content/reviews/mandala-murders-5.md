Officer Rea Thomas and a former cop, Vikram Singh, investigate gruesome ritualistic killings marked by mandala symbols. The narrative connects to the 1950s, where a widowed scientist, Nandini, creates a wish-granting device upon a sinister warning from Rukmini. Ultimately, Vikram’s kidnapping for a sacrifice to revive the deity Yast forces Rea to confront her grandmother’s history to stop the deadly ritual. It feels like Vani Kapoor has built a wall around herself while playing Rea; the portrayal is too ordinary, and the character lacks a strong identity to make any impact. Gullak-fame Vaibhav Raj Gupta is decent as Vikram, but there’s nothing remarkable about the role. In an extended cameo, Shriya Pilgaonkar is the show’s most effective performer, who embraces her greys with immense conviction.
