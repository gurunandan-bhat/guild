The release of Ground Zero has been coloured, inescapably, by the deadly terror attack in Pahalgam, which claimed at least 26 lives and has escalated tensions in the subcontinent. Although the film, drawn from real events, is set in Kashmir in the early 2000s, its climactic showdown — a late-night raid on a terrorist hideout by Border Security Force (BSF) jawans — is bound to feed the current mood. This may work to the film’s advantage, firming up its theatrical prospects even as it muddles its intent. There are nuances here that many viewers, under the circumstances, are likely to ignore. There was a hint of this in the film’s trailer. “Is only the land of Kashmir ours, or its people too?” asks BSF commandant Narendra Nath Dhar Dubey (Emraan Hashmi). It is an important question to pose in this heated atmosphere, with allegations of complicity directed at the Kashmiri people, not to mention threats and attacks against Kashmiri students in other parts of the country. Ground Zero stands apart from works like The Kashmir Filesand Article 370. It is closer in spirit to Shershaah: a patriotic, simple-minded biopic, with a passing yet palpable concern for local lives.
