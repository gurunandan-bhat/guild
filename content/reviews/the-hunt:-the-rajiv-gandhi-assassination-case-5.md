The Hunt: The Rajiv Gandhi Assassination Case is exactly what the title describes. The new SonyLIV series, helmed by filmmaker Nagesh Kukunoor, is focused on the ninety-day period in which a Special Investigation Team (SIT) pieces together who was behind Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. The investigative thriller is based on Anirudhya Mitraâ€™s book Ninety Days: The True Story of the Hunt for Rajiv Gandhi's Assassins and unfolds just like a book you can't put down as the SIT members figure out which LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) operatives carried out the deadly plan. The show dives right into the main event with the former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, played here by Rajiv Kumar, attending a campaign rally in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu, on May 21, 1991. He is killed by a suicide bomber, Dhanu (Shrutie Jayan), and The Hunt wastes no time with the investigation moving from Madras to Colombo to Delhi and more as the suspects grow and the conspiracy deepens. The series' strength lies in the extensive groundwork the SIT undertakes to launch a manhunt to find the plot's leader and his accomplices.
