At the heart of Criminal Justice Season 4: A Family Matter is indeed a family matter, and that of the affluent Nagpal family. Raj Nagpal (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub) and his estranged wife Anju Nagpal (Surveen Chawla) live in the same building, but in different apartments. They share a teenage daughter, Ira, who suffers from Asperger's syndrome. Then there's Raj's mother, Gurmeet, and his girlfriend Roshni Saluja (Asha Negi), who is also Ira's nurse. It's a modern family, and everyone seems to have come to terms with the arrangement. All seems well until one day, their shared househelp Kamala walks in to see a dead Roshni lying in a pool of blood in Raj's arms. Her cry for help reaches Anju, who rushes from next door, and immediately calls up the police. Raj is now the prime suspect in the police investigation and Anju reaches out to lawyer Madhav Mishra (Pankaj Tripathi) for help. What follows is a taut murder investigation - with the angles of police interrogation, courtroom drama and a parallel media trial.
