Anurag Basu's trademark whimsy and frenzy, music and maelstrom of emotions and equations come together once again in his latest. Metro... In Dino, a spiritual sequel to Basu's sparkling 2007 relationship drama Life In A... Metro, follows the anthological template of the first film, as well as the filmmaker's dark comedy caper Ludo, that released five years ago. Unlike Life In A... Metro that drew both its feel and fabric from Mumbai — its incessant rains, its bumper-to-bumper traffic, the connections inadvertently forged and broken on local train rides and the everyday stories of crushed ambitions, lost loves and dreams unrealised — Metro... In Dino doesn't belong to one 'metro'. The action shifts between Mumbai and Pune, Kolkata and Bangalore, Delhi and Goa, with the film not being able to ground itself in any city. Each landscape coalesces into the other, with very little to define the film's backdrop. Physically, Metro... In Dino is all over the place. Which, unfortunately, is an apt descriptor for its structure and storytelling as well.
