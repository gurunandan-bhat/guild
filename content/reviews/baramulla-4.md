There’s something sinister going on in Baramulla, with young children disappearing without a trace. DSP Ridwaan Sayyed (Manav Kaul) is dispatched to the picturesque Kashmir town to investigate, and when he arrives at the house allotted to him, along with wife Gulnaar, and children Noorie (Arista Mehta), and Ayaan (Rohaan Singh), he is pitchforked into a situation he’s never handled before.
