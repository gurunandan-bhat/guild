The political series Maharani returns with a big time jump and a new era as it expands beyond the state. Huma Qureshi is joined by several new faces in this latest instalment that sees the politics and the collaborations grow murkier. This next generation of the Bharti clan is more in focus as they begin to grow their political roots as well. Created by Subhash Kapoor, the SonyLIV show manages to inject more intrigue in its fourth season, leaving audiences keen to wonder what will happen next.
