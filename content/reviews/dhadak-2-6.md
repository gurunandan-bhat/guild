There’s a dialogue by hero Neelesh (Siddhant Chaturvedi) to heroine Vidhi (Triptii Dimri) that goes, ‘Gehri neend mein ho.’ It is like being awakened from deep slumber when director Shazia Iqbal brings Hindi-medium, backward caste Neelesh from the ‘Bheem baja dhol band’ into a law college. It is hard-hitting and if you’re prepared for it, there’s enough going on to draw you in. Neelesh has an interview. There are friends who bring him a pair of shoes. A feisty chawl mother (Anubha Fatehpuria) gives him last-minute instructions, “Listen to your head but speak from the heart.” Ansari (Zakir Hussain), the Principal of the law college, who doesn’t want the reservation quota boy to waste time on ‘Jai Bheem’ politics on the campus. Ahirwar, a surname almost like a slur.
