You know that a film baldly calling itself Bad Girl will be about a girl who is ‘bad’, but you also wonder how it will be different from films about a similar subject that have preceded it. Bad Girl makes no bones about telling us why Ramya (Anjali Sivaraman) is labelled so. All her instincts rebel against what ‘good girls’ are expected to do– be seen, not heard– in fact, not even be seen if that is going to upset her core family, which in Ramya’s case is her mum, dad, and grandmum, as well as school-teachers, principal, and every one else who makes a girl’s business their own, because, of course, a girl has no business that’s strictly her own.
