Anurag Kashyap attempts a return to form with Nishaanchi. The film — with a title that translates roughly to a 'slingshot sniper' — is not only a throwback to the director's audacious, gritty, earthy style of filmmaking but is also an ode to the kind of films that Kashyap — a knee-high movie buff from small-town Gorakhpur — grew up watching. Kashyap marries the raw gangsterism of some of his most seminal films — Satya and Shool (which he wrote) to Black Friday and Gangs of Wasseypur (that he directed) — to the elements of Hindi cinema, both mainstream and parallel, that were rampant in the 1970s and '80s. Many of them may have been stereotypes, but they also formed and subsequently defined the pop-cultural fabric of the cinema of that era.
