The melancholy crime drama Kohrra is back after nearly three years, minus one of its lead actors. While Suvinder Vicky’s Sub-inspector Balbir Singh is missed, he is replaced by the more than worthy Mona Singh as Dhanwant Kaur. And, of course, the excellent Barun Sobti returns as Assistant Sub-Inspector Amarpal Garundi. This time, the character is transferred to Dalerpura, where they investigate a new NRI murder, with dark secrets uncovering another family tragedy. Creators and writers Gunjit Chopra, Diggi Sisodia, and Sudip Sharma have crafted another complex character study that will linger long after the series is watched.
