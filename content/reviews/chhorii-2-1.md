From female foeticide to child marriage, Chhorii's running theme of social evils meets spooky scares seeks to engage its viewer by startling and enlightening them in turns. But Director Vishal Furia's limp and unscary sequel achieves neither in spite of his constant dedication to creepy imagery. Heavily relying on paranoia and paranormal alone, this hastily whipped-up follow-up, unlike the first one that slickly adapted Furia's Marathi horror Lapachhapi, is staggeringly devoid of significance and storytelling. Offering nothing more than an empty allegory on patriarchal control, Chhorii 2's bigger crime is how quickly it collapses under the weight of its drowsy momentum and laughable attempt at giving us the heebie-jeebies.
