In Barbarian, his solo screenwriting and directorial debut, Zach Cregger gave us one of the most watchable horror films in recent times, transforming a generic premise into a truly captivating, suspenseful and thematically rich story. Barbarian, released with a rather flimsy promotional campaign, quickly became a phenomenon, finding favour with even the most staunch horror aficianados. Barbarian's treatment of horror — which was much more than simply jump scares and bloodcurdling screams — heralded the arrival of Cregger as an exciting new voice in a genre which has not always been as inventive as its potential has demanded. Three years later, Cregger is back with Weapons, a more lavishly mounted, studio-backed enterprise led by big names (Josh Brolin, Julia Gardner, Benedict Wong). Post Barbarian, the expectations from Cregger have been high, and in his sophomore directorial, he delivers on most counts.
