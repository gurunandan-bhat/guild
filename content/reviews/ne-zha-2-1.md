One of the biggest releases in animation has reached the Indian shores. The film is the second installment in its series title Ne Zha. Set in a fantasy world, it follows a spirit core and demon core that have been born into children and have to go on long tendinous journey to discover themselves. The sequel explores their story as they have already been accepted by their surrounding but still have more inner acceptable to go through. Ne Zha 2 begins with both Ne Zha and Ao Bing getting their own bodies from the gifted seven coloured lotus. However, before Ao's body is able to take full form he is forced to use his powers to defend Chentang Pass from his father's wrath. Ne Zha promises to bring back an elixir to revive the lotus and make a new body for him. But his demon core would not let him enter the spirit world to win the elixir in a competition. Ne Zha and Ao Bing then decide to share their bodies to win the elixir.
