‘Yahan par hathyakaand hua hai, force bhejiye.’ Small town cop Jatil Yadav and his trusty phatphatiya are back, solving murders most foul. The Lucknow-Kanpur axis is very much present in this spiritual sequel of the 2020 thriller Raat Akeli Hai, as are several key characters, but the ensemble is much bigger, with multiple bodies this time round.
