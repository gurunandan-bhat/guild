A well-crafted war film operates on multiple levels - it provides historical context and details about the progression of specific events, incorporates the human aspects of bravery and sacrifice, and ultimately conveys the message that war is pointless. Regrettably, Border 2, the spiritual successor to Border (1997), fails to meet any of these criteria.
