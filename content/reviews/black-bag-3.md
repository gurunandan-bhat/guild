In his approximately 35-year career, director Steven Soderbergh has made more than a handful of remarkable films. Although he occasionally takes breaks, but he still remains a highly prolific filmmaker. This year, he has two new releases: Black Bag and Presence, the latter is a horror film and both are written by David Koepp. Black Bag is a gripping and entertaining spy thriller that showcases Soderbergh's distinctive style. The film features an exceptional lead duo, Michael Fassbender and Cate Blanchett, who portray a married couple, George and Kathryn. Both work for the British intelligence agency and appear to be deeply in love—until complications arise. As a spy thriller, "Black Bag" combines the intellectual depth of a John Le Carré novel with the romantic tension characteristic of a Hitchcock film, a director not typically associated with romance. The film successfully balances style and substance, a rarity in cinema these days.
