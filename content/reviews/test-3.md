Throw a crore of rupees at Arjun (Siddharth) or a cricket ball, his eye will watch only the ball. Cricket before all else, before family, wife, even school-going son Adi or his own mother’s funeral. And now, he’s batting to save his place in the national team, he’s been in bad form for a couple of matches. Time to retire? The question every star cricketer dreads to hear from the board. Adi’s 30+ schoolteacher Kumudha (Nayanthara) has been warned that she cannot step beyond her duties and get personal with her students. Her obsession – to have a child of her own. The doctor’s told her that this will probably be her last attempt at an IVF procedure. She needs Rs 5 lakh for it. Kumudha’s husband Saravanan alias Sara (R. Madhavan), an MIT trained scientist with a dream project to save fuel. On the sly, will funnel Rs 50 lakh into his dream project, a Rs 50 lakh loan ostensibly taken to upgrade a canteen his late father-in-law had set up for the jobless genius. With the canteen shut and loan sharks at his throat, there’s Kumudha nagging him for Rs 5 lakh.
