+++

When the spunky Angammal (a brilliant Geetha Kailasam) rides her moped and delivers milk, there's a spark in her eyes. The spark tells you that she's leading life by her own rules. But when she's forced to make certain lifestyle changes after her second son Pavalam (Saran) pushes her to, you see the vitality fading. It shows you how little things that made Angammal the fierce matriarch that she is are not acceptable to the generation that comes after hers. It shows how Angammal, the independent woman, is denied the choice. The choice that made her a flawed, foul-mouthed woman with her own ideals.
