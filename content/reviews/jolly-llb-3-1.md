The weak-spined rivalry between Jagdish Tyagi (Arshad Warsi) and “client-chor” Jagdishwar Mishra (Akshay Kumar) evokes barely a smile. The ‘you-take-her’ volleying between them when a penniless Janki Amma (Seema Biswas) comes to them to file a petition against land-grabbing industrialist Haribhai Khaitan (Gajraj Rao) has no humour. Mishra’s banter with wife Pushpa (Huma Qureshi) which had such a spark in 2017 has fizzled out in the intervening years. The gymming, the dating app antics and tearing his hair in the courtroom don’t make Judge Sunder Lal Tripathi (Saurav Shukla) endearing at any point. A Valentine’s Day outing with lady cop Chanchal Chautala (Shilpa Shukla) might’ve been funny if it had ended with Judge Tripathi getting a long bill. But writer-director Subhash Kapoor must stretch it and explain that the Jollys had ‘topi pehnaoed’ him.
