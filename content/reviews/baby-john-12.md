Baby John led by Varun Dhawan is an adaptation of Vijay Thalapathy’s Theri, but adaptation to the 20th century is only restricted to the action and background score. The film unfortunately as most South films do focus on the virtue of women being stolen. Though a serious topic, the film doesn’t take it too seriously as it is merely used to elevate the hero’s role. Vijay's charm is missed amid, VD's commercial cocky performance in the old timeline. While trying to turn him into Arjun Reddy and Ranbir Kapoor from Animal, they missed out on the cool and clam composure the character was supoosed to have as a cop.
