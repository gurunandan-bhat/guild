The second part of Stranger Things opens after the exhilarating and devastating events of the last four episodes of Season 5. Noah Schnapp's Will Byers has powers, and Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) has captured all 12 children to the Upside Down for his grand plan. What's afoot? Co-created by the Duffer Brothers, Matt and Ross, the final season of the Netflix show hurtles towards an epic showdown that promises casualties this time. Who will make it out alive at the end?
