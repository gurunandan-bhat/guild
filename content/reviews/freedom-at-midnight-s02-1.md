One of my favourite scenes in this second season– and there are several– has Jawaharlal Nehru sitting by himself in a large high-ceilinged room. Sardar Patel has just left, with yet another contentious issue left hanging in the air. For a series which leans so heavily into conversation and constant cross-talk, a man alone with his thoughts has weight, giving us time to understand from the comfort and privilege of hindsight, just how hard won our freedom was, which came to us at that famous stroke of the midnight hour.
