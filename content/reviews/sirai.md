Actor Vikram Prabhu’s choice of scripts has been impressive in the recent past. His upcoming venture, Sirai, marks his second collaboration with writer Tamizh (also an actor) after their critically acclaimed Taanakkaran. Sirai, like Taanakkaran, casts Vikram Prabhu's protagonist as a police officer, but from the district armed reserve wing.
