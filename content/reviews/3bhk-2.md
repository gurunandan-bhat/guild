A few years ago, in 2022, came along a nondescript Tamil film titled Kuruthi Aatam, starring Atharvaa. I wrote in my review about this sophomore film from 8 Thotakkal filmmaker Sri Ganesh: “The biggest problem of Kuruthi Aattam is its desire to pack many things into its already-long 149-minute narrative. There’s just too much happening too soon here.” With his latest film, 3BHK,Sri Ganesh sorts this issue out. The first sequence gets you right into the story — and this elaborates what the trailer already beautifully showcased — Vasudevan (Sarath Kumar) and his family want to build a home. Can they? This 140-minute cinematic effort goes into answering this singular question. And as it does that, it veers into the individual journeys of the lead characters — Vasudevan (Sarath Kumar), Prabhu (Siddharth), Shanthi (Devayani) and Aarthi (Meetha Ragunath).
