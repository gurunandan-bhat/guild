Directed by one half of the Safdie brothers, Benny Safdie, The Smashing Machine is inspired by the true story of wrestler and mixed martial arts fighter, Mark Kerr. Although it follows a conventional biopic format, the narrative and the themes it delves into sets it apart from others. Safdie, in his debut solo directorial effort, rightfully earned the Best Director award at the Venice International Film Festival a couple of months ago. Under the direction of a different filmmaker, this narrative could have easily veered off course.
