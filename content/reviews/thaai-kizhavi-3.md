From Disney's Snow White to our own Vidaathu Karuppu, the evil grandma stereotype shines, making an old woman the face of terror and crudeness. Indian TV and its serials have furthered this trope of this evil old matriarch harassing the hapless daughter-in-law. On the other hand, there's another popular archetype of a benevolent old woman, who "melts like a candle" to produce light for those around them. Manormama has been the quintessential choice of Tamil filmmakers for this cardboard cutout. The scene from Shankar's Gentleman, of her telling her son (Arjun Sarja), "Naan irukaen pa" ("I'm there for you"). She is the all-giving mother, and men are supposed to find her godly love and care in their potential mates.
