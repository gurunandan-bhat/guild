The makers have returned with another season explores the culinary world through the restaurant and its highly talented staff. The show has been around for three seasons and always give at least 3-4 perfect episodes per season. Can the same be said for this one? Yes. Season 4 takes a little while to kick off but it does. And when it does there is so much more to look for. The new episodes begins right after season 3 as they begin to feel the wrath of a countdown which could decide the future of the restaurant. After finding out about uncleâ€™s diminishing finances, a running clock is added to the restaurant as a reminder how they need to win a star or break even in 4000 hours. However, to do that Carmen and others have to first get through layers of emotional, their own and others. With a wedding and a new baby in the mist, the family drama also continues the influences the decisions in the kitchen.
