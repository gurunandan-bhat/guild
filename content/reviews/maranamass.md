Dark comedy is a tricky genre that could yield results both ways. The film can turn out insanely funny, or it can fall flat on its face. Of late, there are a lot of dark comedies coming from South. Director Sivaprasad’s ‘Maranamass’ is an addition to the dark comedy genre with Basil Joseph at its core. Basil, who is on a golden run with multiple hits to his credit, picks up Maranamass, elevates it and proves why he is the one to watch out for. A serial killer, known as the banana killer because of his signature move, has murdered three elderly men in a village in Kerala. The police are naturally inclined to suspect Luke PP (Basil Joseph) as the one, courtesy his off-beat character. From burning a school staff room to leaking the search history of a politician, he is the ‘destructive’ force in the village. Luke is in love with Jessie (Anishma Anikumar). But, Jessie is unimpressed with him and has broken up with him.
