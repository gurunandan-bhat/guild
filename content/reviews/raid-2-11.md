Raj Kumar Gupta’s Raid 2 is a sequel of its own 2018 crime thriller Raid and continues the story of Amay Patnaik, an IRS (Indian Revenue Service) officer who still operates with a rigid sense of duty in a system that rarely rewards it. The movie ends with more surprises and twists than one would expect from a movie about tax raids and corruption. Let’s dive into the plot of Raid 2, its ending, and learn all about its cast, release date, and more. Ajay Devgn returns to play the role of Patnaik. This time, he comes face to face with a politician called Dada Manohar Bhai (Riteish Deshmukh), who is something of a darling of his constituency, Bhoj. Initially just a humble shoemaker, he rose in power thanks to popular support as first a state minister and then a cabinet minister. Patnaik, when he is transferred to Bhoj, suspects something is not right despite a feeling of general goodwill towards Dada and happiness suffusing the town. And indeed — spoiler alert — Patnaik is proven right. But even with ample evidence, can he really touch somebody as powerful as Dada Bhai? Not only does he have the state machinery at his disposal, but he is also a darling of the masses, and as we see in the movie multiple times, they would not hesitate to form mobs to sabotage any law enforcement action against him.
