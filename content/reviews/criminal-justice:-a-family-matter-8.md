Raj Nagpal, a revered medico, finds himself on the brink of divorce. Despite their differences, Raj and his wife, Anju, are committed to co-parenting their daughter, Ira, who has Asperger’s syndrome. Amidst the domestic trouble, Raj falls for Roshni, a nurse at his hospital. While the trio initially maintains cordiality, their peace shatters with Roshni’s shocking murder. Raj is taken into police custody, and lawyer Madhav Mishra is out to secure his release. Pankaj Tripathi’s ability to bring grounded-ness and believability to his roles across genres has kept him in good standing for many years now. While the laid-back persona and subtle humour continue to remain the USPs of his performance in project after project, it’s surprising how the petrol in his tank never dries up. Criminal Justice Season 4 is another terrific proof of his talent.
