Vishnu Shankar can’t come to terms with his inability to prevent nuclear physicist Homi Bhabha’s death. Now married, working under RAW, he’s transferred to Pakistan to stop its emergence as a nuclear power, which could mean doomsday to humankind at large. Torn between his conscience and national duty, Vishnu is relentless, however, paying a heavy price for his choices. There’s no better news than Pratik Gandhi getting his due as an actor – even if it’s on OTT more than the big screen. Playing a role modelled on a real-life hero, he doesn’t make a saint out of him, portrays his integrity, while also highlighting his grey areas. Rajat Kapoor, in the shoes of Kao, has it a little too easy; the character is no real test to his mettle.
