“When was the last time we had a drink together?” asks an SIT officer. “When was the last time we slept?” shoots back his colleague. It sums up the captivating 90-day hunt that writer-director Nagesh Kukunoor turns into a 7-part show, making the viewer walk in step with the untiring SIT that’s set up to find Rajiv Gandhi’s killers. We know the LTTE did it. We know why they did it. We know the deep hatred the LTTE had for the leader who sent the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) to quell the militant movement in Sri Lanka. We know they wanted him dead before he became the PM again. We know the LTTE, led by Prabhakaran, bombed, killed, tortured people in their fight for a separate Tamil state of Eelam in Sri Lanka. But there’s more.
