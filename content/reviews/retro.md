What is the purpose of life? Some figure out on their own. Some people need a guiding light. Some die struggling. Director Karthik Subbaraj’s ‘Retro’ is a story of an orphan with a Trishul (a trident) birthmark, who has a strong purpose in life. ‘Retro’ is Subbaraj’s ‘Jigarthanda Double XL’ meets Arun Matheswaran’s ‘Captain Miller’. Is it as effective as ‘Jigarthanda Double XL’? Let’s find out! Paarivelkannan (Suriya) gets adopted by Sandhya (Swastika) and her gangster husband Thilagan (Joju George) after the two follow a few spiritual signs. Thilagan despises Paari as he is not his kid. His childhood drama rips off his smile and happiness, leaving him brooding all the time. When Sandhya dies, Paari is left with no one, but in a quick turn of events, Thilagan accepts Paari when he gives first-hand proof of how he can be an A-class henchman. This whole episode also brings Paari and Rukmini together - both of whom are also grieving the loss of their mother. 14 years later, when Paari meets Rukmini in Coorg, sparks fly. After four years of courtship and several changes in his personality, Paari is now a transformed man, ready to leave his gangster life behind. But, is there a way out when you are neck-deep into a life that’s all about gore and blood? Director Karthik Subbaraj answers this and more in over two hours and 48 minutes.
