Even before a grossly unconvincing twist derived from a popular multi-season web series (in which one of the actors in this film plays the lead) pops up towards the end, Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari has ‘mismatched’ written all over it. Now we aren’t just talking about its central premise — of two ditched exes seeking to win over their respective former partners who are marrying each other at their destination wedding (yes, confusion hi confusion hain, solution ka pata nahin) — but of Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari as a whole.
