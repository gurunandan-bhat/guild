At one point in Good Bad Ugly, Ajith Kumar breaks the fourth wall to directly interact with director Adhik Ravichandran behind the camera. There is no precedence for such a style of filmmaking before and after this scene, and it is a random outlier in a film that revels in its nonchalance and throwing caution to the wind. This scene might not necessarily fit into the story about a gangster-in-exile returning to his old ways to save his son. However, Adhik treats Good Bad Ugly with so much irreverence that this is the least of the outlandish aspects of the film. There is a cameo and a throwback that comes out of nowhere. But we’ll get there in a while.
