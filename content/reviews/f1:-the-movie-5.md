Directed by Joseph Kosinski, who previously directed the Top Gun sequel a few years back, F1: The Movie features a sportsperson (can a Formula 1 driver truly be referred to as a 'sportsperson'?) returning from retirement in pursuit of glory. While the premise may not seem particularly original, it is the storytelling that sustains this film throughout a significant portion of its 155-minute runtime.
