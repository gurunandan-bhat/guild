After four years, 22 episodes, and countless character deaths, the most popular Korean series in the world, Squid Game, finally comes to an end on Netflix. Writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk's deadly saga pitted vulnerable people against one another to win riches beyond their dreams but at a cost that could haunt them forever. Over three seasons, the filmmaker has presented two very different winners of the Squid Game: Hwang In-ho, aka the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun), who becomes the host of the games after his victory, and Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), who wants to save as many people as he can from the games. It's this larger picture of humanity and morality that is explored in the third and final season that answers the question, what remains in the end, greed or integrity?
