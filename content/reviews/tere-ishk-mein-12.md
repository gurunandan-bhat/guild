Director Aanand L Rai's new film poses an old question: can love douse the flames that violence sparks? Its search for an answer takes it nowhere in particular. But inevitably for a film dedicated to "Mahadev and his Ganga", Tere Ishk Mein makes a brief stopover in the holy city of Benaras, where a priest-philosopher (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub in a special appearance) holds forth on love, death and salvation.
