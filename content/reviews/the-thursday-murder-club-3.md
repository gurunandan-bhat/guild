Richard Osman’s 2020 novel The Thursday Murder Club soon became a runaway bestseller and a book-club favourite. Its delightful premise follows four older residents living at Cooper Chase, an expansive English retirement home, who meet weekly to discuss unsolved crimes—only to find themselves entangled in a real-life murder investigation. Osman’s novel balanced wit, warmth and intricate plotting to create a clever and endearing mystery, drawing readers into piecing together clues from a wide field of suspects. The film adaptation, written by Katy Brand and Suzanne Heathcote and directed by Chris Columbus (on Netflix) embraces the same charming setup but inevitably takes a different route. The heart of the story—the idea of senior citizens becoming unlikely detectives—remains intact. The setup too remains playful and refreshing, as older characters take the spotlight in a genre usually dominated by hardened investigators, somewhat like Only Murders in the Building but with only senior sleuths, and set in an English retirement home rather than an American apartment block.
