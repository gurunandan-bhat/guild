On paper, Tanvi the Great is about an autistic young woman who sets out to defy an ableist society and complete her late father’s dream. This “different but no less” 21-year-old humbles and awakens many in the process, not least her grumpy grandfather whom she must reside with during her mother’s business trip. The film is actor Anupam Kher’s second as director after Om Jai Jagdish (2002). He has mentioned in interviews that the story is personal; he drew inspiration from his maternal niece, Tanvi, who has autism. The template is familiar. In the age of Sitaare Zameen Par, it’s hard to make a sub-par movie — more specifically, an insincere one — about a neurodivergent character who beats the odds. The theme is nearly impossible to fumble.
