The latest entrant in Bollywood’s twisted math of intense love = toxicity and male entitlement is Tere Ishk Mein. Which doesn’t come as a surprise considering that this is not new terrain for director Aanand L. Rai. The man is a repeat offender, having glorified stalking and toxic masculinity packaged as a tragic tale of unrequited love a dozen years ago in Raanjhanaa. That Tere Ishk Mein is said to be set in the same universe as Raanjhanaa is significant; that it is backed by a production house (T-Series) which has put monies on films like Animal and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety is even more telling.
