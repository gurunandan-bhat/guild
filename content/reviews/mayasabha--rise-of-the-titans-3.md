Sony LIV’s new Telugu web series, Mayasabha, opens with a familiar disclaimer: any resemblance to real people is purely coincidental. Yet it does not take long to draw parallels between its characters and the political giants who shaped undivided Andhra Pradesh. Echoes of NT Rama Rao, the actor-turned-leader; YS Rajasekhara Reddy, the doctor-turned-politician; and the current chief minister, N Chandrababu Naidu, and several others ripple throughout the storyline. Titled Rise of the Titans, the show’s first season is a sharp and dramatic commentary on the socio-political fabric of the State. Ambitious in scope and often gripping in execution, the series draws viewers into a world of power struggles, shifting loyalties and behind-the-scenes drama.
