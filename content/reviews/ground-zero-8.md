It is impossible to watch this film set in Kashmir without keeping in the mind the tragedy that unfolded in Pahalgam, a couple of days ago. Ground Zero, which draws inspiration from the valor of BSF officer Narendra Nath Dhar Dubey, is set within the context of the Kashmir conflict, albeit during a different period.
