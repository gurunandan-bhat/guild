Relentless Patnaik (Devgn) is a thorn in the lives of the corrupt. He is the party pooper of the privileged who think they can evade law and hence, the chemistry and conflict that unravel once he goes digging has a comic-thrilling element to it. One does not expect efficiency or honesty from public servants let alone heroism and hence the anomaly makes for an interesting watch. The second time around, Raj Kumar Gupta mounts his crime drama on a bigger scale. A brooding Patnaik dressed in formals, enjoys Singham like slowmo entry, glamour and clout. He can be transferred or suspended but he is always in power much against the odds. Ritiesh Deshmukh makes for an interesting no-nonsense, white collared antihero Dadabhai. He is a prodigal son, revered philanthropist and a powerful political leader. He is too good to be true and that leads Patnaik to go sniffing after his massive empire and assets. The two outsmart each other in a series of deceitful activities but only one can emerge victorious.
