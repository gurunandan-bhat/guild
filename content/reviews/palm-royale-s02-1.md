The first season of Apple TV's Palm Royale, while intriguing, had a shaky narrative. That mainly had to do with its large cast of characters; it was hard to keep up with who's who. Loosely based on Juliet McDaniel’s 2018 novel, Mr & Mrs American Pie, the series adds a few more characters and ups the melodrama, making for a confusing watch. Despite the complexity, the ensemble cast of the dark comedy plunges on with their stylish costumes and lavish production that takes the action away from 1960s Palm Beach, Florida.
