Sophia, a CEO, clashes with a reluctant prince Aviraaj while trying to turn their struggling palace into a BnB, sparking an attraction despite their differences. Amidst a sabotaged pitch, a palace photo shoot, and a royal ball where Aviraaj avoids his ex and Jinnie finds romance, their connection deepens. Turning a king, he learns a shocking secret, only for a fundraiser to reveal more family truths. It’s surprising how Ishan Khatter goes about his choices – from the big-scale fantasises to earthy indie films – making him unpredictable as a performer. While Aviraaj as a character may be one-dimensional, he tries to make something out of it, without interfering with the creator’s approach. Bhumi Pednekar is impressive, but appears in autopilot mode with her performance, which works on a surface level, though it doesn’t strike a chord.
