When ‘Panchayat’ first dropped on Prime Video in 2020, it marked a refreshing departure from the crime-based dramas, triggering a new trend, and has since spawned a few clones too. Unlike violence and gaali-infested web shows which rule the OTT space, the offering from TVF (The Viral Fever), the original web content creator of shows like ‘Permanent Roommates’, won hearts and appreciation. With its perfect rural setting, an unusual premise and stellar performances, it figured high on the critics’ meter. Five years later and into its fourth season, it retains the series’ major strengths. Ever since Abhishek Tripathi (Jitendra Kumar), an engineering graduate, landed in the fictional village of Phulera in Uttar Pradesh as Sachivji (the panchayat secretary), all eyes have been on this roller-coaster ride of emotions, drama and laughter. An authentic slice of hinterland, it has brought forth the joys of simple things and the beauty of rural life, laced with subtle political commentary.
