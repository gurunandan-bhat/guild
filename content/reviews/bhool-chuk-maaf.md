Both hopeless romantics, Ranjan (Rajkummar Rao) and Titli (Wamiqa Gabbi) are desperate to get married. When they pull all the strings to make it happen, Ranjan finds himself stuck in a time loop. He keeps waking up on the same day -- a day prior to his wedding day. Bhool Chuk Maaf’s release drama strangely and accidentally paid ode to its theme. From a theatrical release to OTT and back to theatrical release, it kept going in circles too. The film’s story tests your patience equally, but the outcome compensates for the scattered and meandering build-up. Oblivious to the demands of adulting, Banaras sweethearts Ranjan (Rajkummar Rao) and Titli (Wamiqa Gabbi) are obsessed with each other. He doesn’t have a job, and she is too reckless to care. They decide to elope but abort the plan midway because she realises it’s unfair for their parents to face the repercussions. They want to be together but not at the cost of their families’ wellbeing.
