In spite of what the popular perception might be, I can vouch for the fact that film critics still belong in the more forgiving section of the audience. It’s only when the film isn’t working that the mind wanders and inane details grate that much more. In Shashank Khaitan’s Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari, a character introduces someone, whose family business is valued at $1 billion. “How much money is that?” a friend asks, and the reply comes – “Rs 7,000 crore.” If Khaitan’s film was even slightly sincere and disarming, instead of the smug, gassy Hindi film I’ve come to abhor in the last few years, I would’ve overlooked the arithmetic error.
