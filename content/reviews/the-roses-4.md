The Roses is director Jay Roach and screenwriter Tony McNamara’s reimagining of the 1989 film The War of the Roses, which starred Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in an untamed marital war. In the 2025 version, Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman take on the marital troubles of a modern couple in this black comedy that feels at once familiar and also entirely new. Ivy Rose (Colman) and Theo Rose (Cumberbatch), negotiate the challenges of professional and personal life as they move from unshakable love to complete hatred. The Roses’ love story starts just as impulsively as it ends—passionate, spontaneous, till death do them part. She’s a chef, he’s an architect. They move from the UK to California to explore and expand their creativity.
