Song Sung Blue is inspired by the music of Neil Diamond but it is not a biopic of the famed singer. Rather, it presents a biographical narrative of the individuals who established a tribute band dedicated to Neil Diamond. The documentary featuring Mike and Claire Sardina shares the same title as this film and acts as a source of inspiration for the storyline.
