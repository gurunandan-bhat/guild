Vijay Sethupathi and director Arumugakumar's debut collaboration 'Oru Nalla Naal Paathu Solren' polarised audiences completely - viewers either loved its zany approach or absolutely despised it. There's no middle ground. When the duo reunited for 'Ace', expectations were quite so-so. The question remained: Could they craft a film with universal appeal this time around? Letâ€™s find out! Bold Kannan (Vijay Sethupathi) is an enigmatic figure desperate to shed his criminal past and start a new life. His only link to his former life is his last phone call to imprisoned associates. Relocating to Malaysia, he befriends Arivu (Yogi Babu), a rag picker who masquerades as a businessman to impress Kalpana (Divya Pillai), a hotel owner.
