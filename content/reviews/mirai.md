While watching Mirai, I was occasionally reminded of actor Teja Sajja’s earlier film Hanu-Man. That superhero fantasy by director Prasanth Varma, set in a fictional world, drew on devotional texts while borrowing familiar tropes from the genre. Its engaging characters and emotional depth made audiences root for the underdog hero. This time, the canvas is wider, with a larger budget. Cinematographer-director Karthik Gattamneni, who co-wrote Mirai with Manibabu Karanam, crafts a striking visual aesthetic with production designer Nagender Tangala, art director Dasireddy Srinivas, and a skilled visual effects team. Yet beneath the spectacle lies a story that finds its footing in parts, and that makes all the difference. Indian epics are rich with fantasy steeped in devotional fervour — gods, demons, worlds on the brink of darkness, and the triumph of good over evil. What matters, however, is translating such tales into emotionally resonant storytelling for the screen.
