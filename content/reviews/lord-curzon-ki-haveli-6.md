In Lord Curzon Ki Haveli, Anshuman Jha, known for his role as a lover boy in twisted love stories, tells the story of one eventful night, weaving it with mystery, history, and dollops of dark humour. A classic chamber film with crime at its vortex, Lord Curzon Ki Haveli unfolds in a summer home in the UK, where two couples gather for dinner. Rohit (Arjun Mathur) tells Dr Basuki (Paresh Pahuja) and Ira (Rasika Dugal), the guests of his wife, Sanya (Zoha Rahman), that there is a dead body in the large trunk in the drawing room. What seems like an innocuous joke, ignites a heated conversation, revealing the cracks in the relationship between Dr. Basuki and Ira. Gradually, we get a taste of the true menu of the dinner.
