Suits LA is one of the most eagerly awaited shows of the year, and now that it's here, one can only wonder why it was commissioned. Well, actually, we know why. But this redux of Suits is a disappointment on every level. Creator Aaron Korsh introduces a new shark-like lawyer with Stephen Amell's Ted Black, aka the new Harvey Specter. But we all know that the original Suits was a lighting in a bottle. This second spinoff from the same universe does not have the same charm as the original nor does it have the characters required to get invested. The spinoff introduces viewers to hot-shot LA lawyer Ted (Amell), who is on the verge of a big merger with his partner Stuart (Josh McDermitt). Amidst the chaos of all this lies the news that his father (Matt Letscher) is dying back in New York. The premiere episode revolves around our introduction of Ted's world, his fight to keep his firm and glimpses of his troubled past and shaky relationship with his father. A few generic supporting characters flit in and out.
