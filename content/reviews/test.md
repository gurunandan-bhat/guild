Netflix's first Tamil original, Test, is a fine character study with star power. However, in the sports portions, S Sashikanth's feature lacks the tension that would elevate the film further. R Madhavan, Nayanthara, and Siddharth play characters who are forced to expose their darkest sides when they are pushed to their limits. When the film remains focused on their internal conflicts, the 'test' they are enduring, Test, is at its best. If you're coming in looking for a sports drama, this thriller is more interested in the human aspect and the damage we can inflict upon one another. Test is the story of three headstrong individuals. Siddharth is Arjun, India's most successful batsman on the verge of retirement. Saravanan (Madhavan) and Kumudha (Nayanthara) are a couple on the verge of having their dreams come true. After a decade of trying and failing, Kumudha is going for one last attempt at motherhood through IVF. A former MIT graduate and scientist, Sara is about to land a deal that will revive his career and help the country. Sara's and Kumudha's futures are tied into Arjun's as an important test match begins in Chennai against Pakistan.
