Honest customs officer up against a wall of corruption. Costao, based on the real-life story of Costao Fernandes who fought with all his might to stall gold-smuggling in the Goa of the 90s, has Nawazuddin Siddiqui in a role that’s worthy of his talents, but a script which is distinctly lacklustre. A film that starts with a voiceover alerts you to the fact that the writers couldn’t find a more original way to tell their story. In this instance, Costao’s loving daughter is made the conduit, and the film becomes as much tell as it is show.
