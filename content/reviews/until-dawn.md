A year after her sister Melanie goes missing under mysterious circumstances, Clover (Ella Rubin) and her friends decide to trace her journey. This leads them to an abandoned house in Glore valley, where an hourglass sand timer decides their fate. As the clock starts ticking, each one is haunted and slaughtered by a masked killer. However, as time passes, they are resurrected and made to relive the evening that seals their death. They are horrified to discover that they will be killed over and over again until they find a way to survive the night and escape this death loop.
