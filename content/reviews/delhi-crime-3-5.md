A hit series churning out multiple seasons is like a small startup that’s teased by old clients when it becomes a unicorn. It invites those classic jibes: “oh you’re too big for us now” and “boss you’ve changed”. After the success of Season 1 of Delhi Crime, most viewers went into Season 2 anticipating this change — maybe it’ll be safer, more templatised, splashier and simpler. But despite a creator shuffle, Season 2 not only reinforced an honest personality and forensic gaze, it also addressed criticisms of the first season by humanising its Delhi Police characters — warts, blind spots and all — rather than glorifying them. The popularity, if anything, made it more introspective.
