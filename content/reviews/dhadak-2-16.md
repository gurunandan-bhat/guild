Uske paisa hain izzat hain, SUV hain aur apni hi caste ka hain to kyun na karu shaadi” (he has respect, wealth, an SUV and he is from our caste so why shouldn’t I marry him), remarks the sister of the protagonist. The theme of caste is prominently featured in Dhadak 2, a remake of the Tamil film Pariyerum Perumal (2018) directed by Mari Selvaraj. This film serves as a spiritual sequel to Dhadak (2018), which itself was a remake of Sairat (2016).
