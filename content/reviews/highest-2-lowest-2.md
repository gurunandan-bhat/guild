Reuniting for the first time in nearly two decades, director Spike Lee and star Denzel Washington are gazing inwards in Highest 2 Lowest. The crime-thriller premiered at Cannes earlier this year — as an official selection; not like something Anupam Kher might claim to have taken to the festival — and received a token theatrical release before dropping on Apple TV+. The wait was worth it. Over the last few decades, Washington and Lee have established themselves as perhaps the most vital voices in Black cinema. It is a position that the protagonist of Highest 2 Lowest finds himself in as well. David King doesn’t work in the movie business, but he is described as a kingmaker in the world of music. In many ways, he is a stand-in for both the filmmaker and his favourite star.
