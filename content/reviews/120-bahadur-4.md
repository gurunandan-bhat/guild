As civilians, most of us are not familiar with war fields. We hear stories from folklore, listen to ballads of valour, and then there is cinema. When you think about such a space, what’s the most heartrending image that appears in your mind? To me, it’s a soldier’s wallet – the one he carries into battle. However dramatic that might sound, it usually has a picture of his loved ones – spouse, children, parents. In Razneesh ‘Razy’ Ghai’s 120 Bahadur, too, we get a fleeting moment like that. For once, I thought to myself, why is it important to show it? The answer is more of a question rather. As we live safely nestled in our homes, catching the war news bulletin with our loved ones, do we think about a soldier’s family or his or her life at all?
