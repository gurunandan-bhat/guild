The opening scene, filmed in a single continuous shot, establishes the atmosphere for a film aptly named Jugnuma â€“ The Fable. We observe the main character, Dev (Manoj Bajpayee), as he washes his face, prepares himself, dons his wings, and leaps off a ramp from a mountain, just like that. This film by Raam Reddy, who previously entertained us aplenty with Tithi (2015), encompasses a bit of everything.
