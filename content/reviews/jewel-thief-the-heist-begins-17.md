What can be more exciting than a heist drama which invariably gets us the requisite dose of adrenalin rush? Back in time, there was the Dev Anand-starrer ‘Jewel Thief’ and more recently, Netflix’s Spanish drama ‘Money Heist’, which captured our imagination and set it afire. So, as yet another tale of a suave thief, a con artist at that, drops on Netflix, we are all agog. Only, our enthusiasm doesn’t last too long. In walks one of our favourites and undisputedly the industry’s finest actor, Jaideep Ahlawat, as Rajan Aulakh. Donning shirtless suits, tattoos and chains adorning his much slimmer neckline, he is quite the crime lord masquerading as an art curator. In a few moments, it is established that he is the villain of the piece. Since he has lost a major chunk of his wealth, he needs to steal Red Sun, a huge African diamond valued at Rs 500 crore, soon to be exhibited in an Indian museum. Only, he is not skilled enough to pull off the job himself and has to hire a jewel thief. Enter our hero Reyan Roy (Saif Ali Khan), whose sleight of hand is very much in sight; yes, stealing the very necklace he has gifted the very beautiful woman he sleeps with.
