Anubhav Sinha directs a script by Gaurav Solanki and himself, to craft a courtroom drama that approaches sexual violence through the lens of law, procedure and the domestic impact of violence. The film begins in the hard-hitting way it means to proceed, sparing no punches. Parima, the survivor, played by Kani Kusruti, is introduced as a working woman who lives independently and moves through the city on her own terms. She shares an easy relationship with her husband Vinay (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub). Parima travels alone at night in Delhi, something the film initially treats as completely normal, until she notices a car following her. The rape sequence that follows is intentionally hard to watch, with the glee of the men juxtaposed with the heartless, brutal violence against the woman. Only later, in the courtroom, does her decision to be out alone at night get quietly reframed as poor judgement, revealing how quickly a woman’s independence can be turned against her.
