Director Ezhil captured a particular sense of humour with his films Desinguraja and Velainu Vandhutta Vellaikaaran, where the villain and the conflict have no serious bearing on the film. The plot or the semblance of such is just a device to hold together a series of gags with eccentric characters that had a decent hit rate. Ravi Maria’s Bhootham and Robo Shankar’s MLA Jacket Janakiraman climactic scene in Velainu Vandhutta Vellaikaaran is the pinnacle of the success of such humour. Ezhil, naturally, has attempted to emulate the same with his new outing Desinguraja 2, which has backfired. The reason could be that the latest doesn’t seem to have even the wafer thin plots his previous ventures had. Also, the humour here is tasteless and desperate leaving you with a bad aftertaste.
