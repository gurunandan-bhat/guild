Jatadhara movie review: Ghostbusters. Tantrics. Demons. Jatadhara picks up on elements made popular by the current rash of supernatural thrillers–Kantara, Stree– for a Sudheer Babu film which has Sonakshi Sinha making her Telugu debut. Pre-interval, Jatadhara meanders about setting up scenes between the believers and the naysayers. Shiva (Sudheer Babu) packs devices which are meant to go beep in the presence of spirits. He uses these liberally wherever he is, whether it is in the ruins where he bumps into pretty damsel Sitara (Divya Khossla), or sneaking into a tantric ritual where no such instruments are allowed.
