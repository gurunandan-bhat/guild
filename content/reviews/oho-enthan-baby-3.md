Any film that begins with a narrator introducing the hero immediately raises a suspicion. If cliches are alphabets, it is A. Oh Enthan Baby kicked off with Vishnu Vishal’s (who has played an extended cameo) narration introducing his brother Rudra as Ashwin, and the dutiful brother also preps us that the film is about three of his romances in different stages in life. As you get ready for further such datedness, director Krishnakumar Ramakumar manages to surprise you. The first surprise came in the form of scenes parodising Vijay and Ajith Kumar. It was bold and funny, and I was piqued. While there were no such risks again as the film followed many of the rom-com tropes, it managed to be enjoyable, thanks to the director’s nonchalant and self-aware treatment of a rather tested story.
