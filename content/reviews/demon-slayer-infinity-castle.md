Demon Slayer Infinity Castle has finally hit the big screen in India, and though the tickets have caused quite the ruckus among fans, the 155 minutes are worth the long wait. The film kicks off right at the end of the last season, with almost the entire Demon Slayer corps being pulled into the Infinity Castle after Muzan is attacked by the Hashiras at Kagaya Ubuyashiki's house. Infinity Castle is filled with fan service as each character is touched upon, while also diving deeper into the story for a few of the characters in the same format that the show goes through. All Demon Slayer films, or other franchise anime films, have focused on providing a recap of the final battle and then diving into the new season. However, with the new films for the Infinity Castle arc the makers are taking a filmmaking approach. For the first time, we do get a recap, but through a new perspective to avoid any kind of repetition. Instead of watching the final moments of Muzan's fight or Kagaya Ubuyashiki's interaction with Muzan, we get the preparation he put into the trap through Hashira Gyomei Himejima's perspective.
