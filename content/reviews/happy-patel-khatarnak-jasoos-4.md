Happy Patel: Khatarnak Jasoos is like that restless kid in school whose sense of humour is so niche and Hollywood-coded that he decides to employ Indian-ness as a punchline to impress his elite classmates. He hits them with wave after wave of wonky NRI accents, Bollywood tomfoolery, spoofy imitations, endless pranks, so-unfunny-it’s-funny cultural gags — until the classmates start to enjoy his enthusiasm. His madness becomes infectious, even if he’s just too much of an acquired taste at times, because he arrives every morning with a sole purpose: to play the fool. Who doesn’t fancy a comedian that commits to their image, swings for the fences, and turns their own pandering into a joke? Maybe the kid’s comfort watch is Delhi Belly.
