There’s a germ of a promise when the credits open with how his parents, Sherni and Dilbag named him Sherdil and a peppy rap follows. But genius in the guise of eccentric sleuths is such a familiar central character that when Sherdil (Diljit Dosanjh) punctuates other people’s dialogues with music from his harmonica, his studied cool grates. The setting too is familiar though it is pleasing to the eye. Murder in a billionaire’s mansion in Budapest. Sherdil is like James Bond, vacationing between cases. “Bade bade cases solve karta hoon aur chhote chhote vacations gift karta hoon.” But when Indian-origin billionaire Pankaj Bhatti (Boman Irani) is assassinated in his car, Sherdil is piqued.
