Writer-director Kunal Kemmu’s Madgaon Express smartly avoids taking the sleazy route and mostly succeeds in finding the soul of its cartoonish characters. We talk about the film’s familiar set-up, and how it transports a Hangover-like premise to India. We also discuss the performances of Divyenndu, Pratik Gandhi and Avinash Tiwary, while noting the tightrope walk actors have to pull off in absurd films like this. We praise Kemmu’s handling of the climax, his gag-a-minute narrative, and his self-awareness, but also note flaws in the film’s central action sequence.
