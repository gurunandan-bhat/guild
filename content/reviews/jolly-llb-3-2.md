Are two Jollys better than one? In Subhash Kapoor's latest film Jolly LLB 3 the maker brings actors Arshad Warsi and Akshay Kumar together for a courtroom dramedy. Both Arjsad and Akshay have played Jolly LLB in the previous two films, and the fact that Kapoor has managed to bring the two together in the sequel is perhaps the biggest draw of this film. There are fans (like me) who loved Jolly LLB with Arshad Warsi in the lead. An honest, genuine issue-based film - it had surprised me pleasantly when it was released. Kumar's take in the sequel was more commercial, featuring the actor's usual theatrics and some dance numbers. It obviously had its fan base. So, to bring the two characters for the third part and tell a story effectively is a great feat for the makers.
