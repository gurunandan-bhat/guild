It’s 2025, and Bollywood is still peddling the trope of two youngsters pretending to be lovers just to make their exes jealous. Shashank Khaitan’s Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari is a remake of a remake of a hundred other remakes. And no, it’s not a spoiler to say Sunny will end up with Tulsi. So how do you sell it? Shoot a string of glossy music videos and hope nobody notices the lack of effort.
