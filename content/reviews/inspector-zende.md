Inspector Zende, led by Manoj Bajpayee and Jim Sarbh, is directed by Chinmay Mandlekar and follows the story based on real incidents in the 1990s as the Mumbai police tries to catch a dangerous escaped convict from Tihar Jail. The team of Mumbai police officers is led by Madhukar Bapurao Zende, who knows the convict and had previously caught him. The film brings a comic aspect to the real story, which sits well with the simple, wholesome nostalgia of the 90s. The film begins with Madhukar Bapurao Zende going on about his usual family duties of buying milk early in the morning. However, the radio announcer reveals that one of the most notorious criminals of the country, aka Carl Bhojraj, aka the Swimsuit killer, has escaped from Tihar jail with four other criminals. With Zende being the one who caught Carl in 1971, fifteen years before the story is set in 1986, he rushes to the police station, waiting for the call to brief him on the mission to catch Carl once again.
