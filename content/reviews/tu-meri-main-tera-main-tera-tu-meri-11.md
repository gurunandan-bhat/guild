Directed by Sameer Vidwans, the film Tu Meri Main Tera Main Tera Tu Meri  is proof that a film and it’s title can be overwhelmingly long. The title itself gives us adequate warning and feels like an endurance test, and the film faithfully lives up to it. By the midpoint, which feels like an eternity, one realizes that only half of the title has been addressed.
