I recently watched this Kannada film called Su from So. It’s written and directed by a debut filmmaker, J. P. Thuminad and produced by Raj Shetty, and has surprisingly turned into a huge hit. The film has gone from regional obscurity to almost a national sensation. What struck me most is its vibe; it feels very much like modern Malayalam cinema. Easygoing, not trying to be grand or over-ambitious, but simply a filmmaker telling a story with a camera. And that simplicity is part of its charm. At its heart, Su from So is about small-town lives. How everyone’s closely knit, and how even the tiniest incidents become the biggest entertainment in the predictable rhythm of everyday life. The story is anchored by two characters, Ravi Anna (Shaneel Gautham), a respected, unmarried man in the village, and a younger guy Ashoka (played by J. P. Thuminad, yes the director) who has a crush on a local girl.
