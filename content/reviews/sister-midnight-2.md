Writer-director Karan Kandhari’s mischievous and daring feature debut is a fever dream that veers wildly and often thrillingly between tones: psychological drama, dark domestic comedy, surreal horror fable, and something more inscrutable still. The 119-minute film is anchored by Radhika Apte’s phenomenal turn as an unhappy and restless woman transplanted to the isolating corners of modern-day Mumbai from her rural village only to be caught in circumstances too strange to summarize.
