A bunch of friends, after a night of heavy drinking, wake up to find one of them dead. Panic-stricken, the four of them try to get rid of the body, and thus begins their car ride, and the audience’s excruciating ordeal that lasts for 100 minutes. Manidhargal, a crowd-funded movie, has a core problem of being an inadequate idea for a feature film. The story is wafer-thin that would have suited a short flick as the sequences are redundant without any major development or revelation. Though Manidhargal is a relatively short feature film, it can feel exhausting to watch, especially as the scenes of grown men crying and panicking become difficult to endure. Kaali (Kapil Velavan) is supposed to be the hard-boiled character in the film, who doesn’t break till the end. Mano (Gunavarthan) is the crybaby, who doesn’t stop his antics. Sathish (Dhasha) is a relatively sane guy who also starts wailing as the clock ticks. Samba Sivam as Chandru seems to have drunk something potent than Absinthe, because he doesn’t seem to sober up. Arjun Dev as Deepan is part of the film because having just three characters would make the painful redundancy obvious. The four lead actors are like emojis that don’t change their expression.
