In Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba, Taapsee Pannu and Vikrant Massey return as the murderous couple of hell who were introduced in 2021’s Haseen Dilruba. The sequel boasts an entirely different visual aesthetic and its romantic-thriller tone stands in contrast to the tongue-in-cheek pulpiness of the first film. We discuss what a huge mistake this is, while also trying to wrap our heads around the film’s illogical non-linear plot. We also talk about Pannu and Massey’s one-note performances and the pointless introduction of a couple of new characters, played by Sunny Kaushal and Jimmy Shergill.
