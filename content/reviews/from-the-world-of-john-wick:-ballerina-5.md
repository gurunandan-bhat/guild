A spin-off of the John Wick films, Ballerina represents the fifth installment in the franchise known for its unrestrained action. Additionally, the extended title (From the World of John Wick: Ballerina) indicates that the filmmakers intended for audiences to recognize this as a John Wick film, rather than a standalone entry.
