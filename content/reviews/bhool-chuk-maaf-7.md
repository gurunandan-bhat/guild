It's only fitting that Rajkummar Rao's newest comedy should be about him being stuck in a time loop and unable to find a breakthrough. Lately that's how watching the actor feels in one interchangeable performance after another wherein he's a perennially exasperated small town lad grappling with rom-com crisis. A similar air of déjà vu envelops his character Ranjan Tiwari in Karan Sharma's Bhool Chuk Maaf as well as the viewer while beholding familiar sights and stock. Only this time the setting is Banaras teeming with visuals of ghats, genda phools and gobar.
