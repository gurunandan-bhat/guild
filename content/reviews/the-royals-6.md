The Royals packs in every bit of drama, comedy, and romantic tension in its eight episodes. Teeming with a large cast of characters, the series focuses on the romance between a Maharaja and a Madam CEO. While their love story anchors the show, the lives of the supporting characters too deserve a bit more attention. Co-created by Rangita Pritish Nandy and Ishita Pritish Nandy, the Netflix series is in a similar vein to Four More Shots Please! also produced by the same company. However, the Indian royal setting in Rajasthan adds that extra bit of glamour. Ishaan Khatter is Aviraaj Singh, the reluctant heir to the royal throne of Morpur, who meets his match in WorkPotato CEO Sophia Kanmani Shekhar (Bhumi Pednekar). Opposites attract and then proceed to spend much of the show denying their feelings for one another as they work to transform the palace Motibagh into a royal bed and breakfast. Around them, there are many saboteurs and well-wishers, and both Sophia's company and the crumbling Morpur estate act as a hindrance. Then, of course, there are the other members of the royal family who are dealing with their own issues after the death of the previous Maharaja (Milind Soman).
