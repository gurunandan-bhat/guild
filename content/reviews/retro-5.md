Suriya was left bruised and bloodied — figuratively speaking — after the release of his much-hyped film Kanguva. Years of promotions pitched it as Tamil cinema’s answer to Baahubali, setting up massive expectations among audiences. But when the film finally released, it fell woefully short of delivering on that promise. To make matters worse, it became a target of a systematic and persistent online attack that further ensured its disastrous box office run. Kanguva’s failure was especially brutal — it visibly shook Suriya’s confidence. That uncertainty was evident in the way he promoted Retro. He avoided overhyping it, spoke cautiously, and refrained from the aggressive push we’ve seen from him in the past. Once bitten, twice shy, right?
