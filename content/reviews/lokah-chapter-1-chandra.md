Superhero thrillers in Malayalam are rare to come by. After the phenomenal success of ‘Minnal Murali’, the genre was nowhere to be seen. Now, director Dominic Arun has revived it with ‘Lokah Chapter 1: Chandra’. He blends a Malayalam folklore with the superhero genre, more prevalent in the West, to gift viewers the best of both worlds. Is ‘Lokah Chapter 1: Chandra’ a worthy addition to the superhero genre? Let’s find out! Chandra (Kalyani Priyadarshan), a mysterious woman with superpowers, arrives in Bengaluru on a mission involving Moothon. The city faces a spate of missing person cases linked to organ trafficking. Chandra takes a bakery job and displays odd habits, while three curious young men living opposite her become fascinated by her.
