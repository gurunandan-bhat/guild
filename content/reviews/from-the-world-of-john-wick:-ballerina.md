Following the murder of her father, Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas) is trained to be an assassin by criminal organisation Ruska Roma. Once on field, she goes rogue in pursuit of the man who destroyed her family. To achieve that, she needs to fight his entire tribe on her own. Hollywood has generated a spade of female-led badass babe-action thrillers. Angelina Jolie in Salt and Wanted, Scarlett Johansson starrer Black Widow, Jennifer Lawrence in Red Sparrow, Linda Hamilton in Terminator, the examples are plenty. What sets Ballerina apart, beyond its terrific action choreography, is its casting. Ana de Armas’ Eve is fierce yet feminine. She’s hardened by life but not bereft of emotion. The softness of her past isn’t eroded by the brutalities of her present. She kills like an assassin but empathises like a woman--she fights like a girl. Director Len Wiseman creates a distinct lead that doesn’t aspire to be a John Wick and Ana de Armas’ casting is a cherry on top. The actress blends pulsating action and vulnerability flawlessly. She is one woman army who only trusts her instincts.
