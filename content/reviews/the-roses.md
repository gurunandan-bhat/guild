The Roses is directed by veteran comedy director Jay Roach, with a script written by two-time Oscar nominee Tony McNamara. It is based on the popular 1981 novel The War of the Roses by Warren Adler, and sort of is the remake of its first on screen adaptation from 1989 film of the same name. The film follows Theo Rose a successful architect and his wife Ivy Rose an up-and-coming restaurateur through many years of their marriage and how it evolved and changed them over the years. Played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman, these characters bring your worst nightmare to life while turning your belly up with dark humour that has been missing from the screens for a long time.
