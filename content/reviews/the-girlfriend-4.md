Seeing Rashmika Mandanna in the Telugu film The Girlfriend draws a mix of both pleasure and disconcertment. For the first half-hour or so, her Bhooma Devi seems eerily reminiscent of Animal’s Geetanjali, for she finds herself in a relationship so quickly that it doesn’t even dawn on her whether she wanted it or not. Does Mandanna realise the parallels drawn, one wonders. The Girlfriend, though, is in no mood to show Bhooma and Geetanjali as soul sisters. Not what Bhooma endures but what she realises—a tad slowly—is where The Girlfriend becomes the relationship horror that will leave audiences, especially women, uncomfortable with the warped notion of romance.
