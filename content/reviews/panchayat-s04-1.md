The tough part about the fourth season of a popular series is the fear of ambience fatigue defeating the charm of what began five years ago. Additionally, it’s election time in Phulera, the village where government official Abhishek Tripathi (Jitendra Kumar) has settled down comfortably as the Sachivji (panchayat secretary). It’s therefore daunting for directors Deepak Kumar Mishra and Akshat Vijaywargiya and writer Chandan Kumar to keep the appeal alive especially when politics at any level is awash with the familiar. Between Pradhanji Brijbhushan Dubey (Raghubir Yadav) alongside wife Manjudevi (Neena Gupta) and the rival camp led by Bhushan (Durgesh Kumar) with his wife Krantidevi (Sunita Rajwar), the campaign gets ugly. One-upmanship over cleaning campaigns, restoring electricity, trading seva-meva charges and ego tiffs over laddoos and kachoris are strewn all over the campaign trail. In the fray are also political godfathers, coteries of loyalists and regime change upsets. Sympathy votes and politicising a son’s death are disturbing realities. “But it’s all a part of politics,” Pradhanji periodically reminds everyone.
