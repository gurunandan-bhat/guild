When things take a dark turn in Rana Naidu season two, Rana (Rana Daggubati) tries to reassure his daughter Nitya (Afrah Sayed) that everything will be fine. She retorts that nothing will ever be the same. This exchange encapsulates the story’s core, which follows the consequences of Rana’s actions as a fixer in Mumbai, tasked with managing the scandals of celebrities. Written by Karan Anshuman and Ryan Soares, with dialogues by Vaibhav Vishal, the series is directed by Suparn S Varma, Karan Anshuman and Abhay Chopra. It traces Rana’s attempts to protect his family while continuing his long-standing conflict with his father, Naga Naidu (Venkatesh Daggubati). Loosely adapted from the American series Ray Donovan, the first season drew criticism for making Venkatesh, a long-time favourite in Telugu family films, deliver frequent expletives for shock effect. The new season offers a more restrained portrayal. Venkatesh avoids most of the profanity, though others around him do not. Unlike the first season, which opened provocatively, this one begins with Venkatesh practising pranayama — the calm before the storm.
