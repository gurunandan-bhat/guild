There’s nothing the makers of War 2 will not do to show the audience a good time. Affording stylish entry sequences to its stars, showcasing their well-sculpted bodies (including Kiara Advani in swim-wear, looking disturbingly photo-shopped), chase scenes in picturesque European cities borrowed from James Bond, Mission: Impossible and Jason Bourne films, dance-offs between its two nimble-footed male leads (Hrithik Roshan and NTR), patriotism, (cautious) pro-poor commentary, CGI wolves, B-movie twists, and flashbacks that put Ekta Kapoor’s soap-operas to shame. Sit back, and pick your poison. Directed by Ayan Mukerji, this sequel to Siddharth Anand’s 2019 film only cares about beauty, glamour, sleekness, and entertainment. And whatever it takes to engineer them. One might wonder why NTR is talking using a catch-phrase of a mass Telugu hero in RAW meetings. Or why Kiara Advani’s hair appears blow-dried in most scenes – even though a spy would prefer to have her hair tied (especially if she’s in the field). And then the ancient caveat dawned on me – how can anyone expect logic in a commercial film? Mukerji’s film sees everything only for its aesthetic value.
