Not-so-sharp but daringly self-aware, The Ba*\*\*ds of Bollywood* (short for Bastards of Bollywood) is less of a scathing satire and more of an edgy, meta love letter to the film industry. At its heart, it’s a forbidden love story between an outsider and a nepo kid, building towards an unhinged, glorious climax that fully justifies the show’s title. It may just be one of the boldest creative swings Bollywood has seen in recent memory. The seven-part series follows Aasmaan, a promising newcomer whose debut hit doesn’t guarantee an easy ride. He’s soon entangled in the murky politics of the industry—dodging shady contracts, tiptoeing around egoistic producers, managing superstar tantrums, tackling pesky paparazzi, and fending off competition from privileged insiders. Things only get more complicated when he grows close to his co-star, Karishma Talvar (Sahher Bambba), daughter of megastar Ajay Talvar (Bobby Deol). Ajay has his eyes set on a bigger launchpad for Karishma—preferably opposite someone like Ranveer Singh and not some rising outsider. When Aasmaan refuses to play by the industry's unspoken rules, things spiral fast.
