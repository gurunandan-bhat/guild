Seven years after the harrowing events of Chhorii, Sakshi leads a peaceful life with her daughter, Ishani. The latter suffers from a rare condition where exposure to sunlight can prove fatal. Their peace is shattered one night when a ghostly figure appears and lures Ishani away. When Sakshi returns home to find her daughter missing, she desperately seeks help from Inspector Samar. In terms of performances, Chhorii 2 is an out and out Soha Ali Khan show. She brings an undeniable authority and composure to the portrayal of Daasi Maa, a key architect behind an archaic ritual that usurps the lives of girls. While Nushrat Bharucha is effective as a mother who leaves no stone unturned to protect her daughter, the film doesnâ€™t demand anything significantly different from her as a performer (in comparison to the first part).
