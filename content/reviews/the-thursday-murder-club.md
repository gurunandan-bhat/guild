After Harry Potter, filmmaker Chris Columbus spearheads another popular franchise. The Netflix film, The Thursday Murder Club, is the first of five books about four retired senior citizens who solve murders. Richard Osman's mysteries are bestsellers worldwide and this first film casts Oscar winners and popular British stars in the main roles. The result is a cheeky and delightful romp across the countryside as the retirees try to save their retirement home and figure out who is willing to kill for the land it's built on.
