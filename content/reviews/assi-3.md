When a film talks about a crime as dastardly as rape, gang rape in this case, its social import is disturbing. The nocturnal rape of schoolteacher Parima (Kani Kusruti) on a lonely stretch in Delhi, brings out all that’s expected of a crime. Those equipped to get away with it, will escape jail term without too much of a compromise with the conscience. The victim will stay traumatised, the family bewildered, helpless. The lawyer will fight but justice will be frustratingly elusive. Writer-director Anubhav Sinha’s opening shot of a mercilessly beaten woman thrown on a railway track is unambiguous in its intent.
