There’s a moment of great wisdom in Sunny Sanskari ki Tulsi Kumaari (SSKTK) as a father tells his daughter, a teacher no less, of the great significance of self-respect in relationships as well as in life. The father then disappears, never to be seen. The daughter hearing the pep talk intently is Ananya (Janhvi Kapoor) who is on her way to attend the wedding of her ex Vikram’s (Rohit Saraf) in Udaipur. The next 100 minutes or so she spends entirely negating what her dad spoke about as she pretends to be in love with Sunny (Varun Dhawan) who is there to break-up Vikram’s wedding with his own ex Ananya (Sanya Malhotra). The jilted lovers hope their amorous antics would make their exes jealous and eventually return to them.
