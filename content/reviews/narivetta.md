What do ‘Jigarthanda Double X’, ‘Viduthalai 2’, and ‘Narivetta’ have in common? It has protagonists who fall victim to systemic oppression - a hero who represents a system, later realises the truth, who represents the right, and who fights for what’s right, even if it means an end to one’s life. Varghese Peter (Tovino Thomas) is a man, much like his father. The two men are not interested in doing simple jobs to pass the day. They aim high, which is a testament to their potential. Varghese lives with his mother after his father took his life. He is awaiting calls for two jobs – a village assistant and a police constable. Varghese, who doesn’t think twice about borrowing money from the women in his life, is uninterested in both jobs.
