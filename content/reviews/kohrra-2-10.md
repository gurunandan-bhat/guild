It is not unusual for a good show to be renewed for a new season. What is unusual, however, is for the merit to be inherited, the voice to be sharpened, and the new work to feel like an organic extension and a distinct entity. One that occupies familiar space and yet grows new legs. Few showrunners in the Indian streaming landscape do it like Sudip Sharma. The sophomore season of Paatal Lok (2025), a structurally nuanced follow-up to a still-alive series, was an early example, and the new edition of Kohrra, marking his directorial debut, reiterates it.
