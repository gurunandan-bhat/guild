Panchayat season 4 settles down more into its tone after an intense conclusion to season 3. At the end of the previous season we witnessed the politics in the village taking a new turn as violence grew into an everyday occurrence. Over the years, the show has changed a lot. It first started with everyday adventure format where different incidents took place in the village and explored how it affected Abhishek. Now, the series in more about two political parties fighting against each other to rule the village. The season begins in the aftermath of Pradhanji being shot at. With the village elections coming closer, both parties try to pull each other down and de-influence the villagers. On the other hand, Abhishek appears for his MBA exam and is awaiting the results. The show does explore his dilemma about his future outside the village. However, he is determined to stay back and help Pradhanji and his family for as long as he can. His relationship with Rinki also grows steadily with an imminent separation in the future.
