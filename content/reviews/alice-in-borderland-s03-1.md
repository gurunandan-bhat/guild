Before Squid Game, there was the Japanese series Alice in Borderland about players in life-or-death games. Returning five years after the Shibuya meteorite incident, Alice in Borderland's third season puts its protagonists Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) and Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya) back in dire danger. As the games resume in Borderland, the games become more elaborate with higher stakes. The events of Season 3 veer away from Haro Aso's manga while sticking to its essence. The second half picks up to return to the show that entralled fans over five years and should leave them wanting more.
