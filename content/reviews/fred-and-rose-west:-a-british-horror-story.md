Even regular watchers of true crime like me will find it extremely harrowing to sit through Fred and Rose West, whose logline of 'A British Horror Story' doesn't even come close to describing what a turbulent ride this newest offering from Netflix is. For those familiar with the gruesome details of the case, the three-part documentary will function as an uncomfortable throwback. For those like me who didn't know about it at all, Fred and Rose West is yet another (and, by far, most shocking) eye-opener of the depravity that humankind is capable of.
