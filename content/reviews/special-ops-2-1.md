Once again, artificial intelligence is the focus of the narrative in the spy series Special Ops 2. Kay Kay Menon returns for a third time as senior RAW officer Himmat Singh, who is the only one equipped to take on the latest antagonist. Created by Neeraj Pandey, the series hurtles into yet another terror plot that threatens India, but this time one of India's brightest minds needs to be rescued as well. Special Ops 2 doesn't waste any time rushing off into the next mystery, and it's only in the second half when all the details finally begin to make sense. The series opens with the abduction of Dr Piyush Bhargava (Arif Zakaria), who heads classified programs holding the key to several Indian organizations. Meanwhile, the Indian intelligence team loses one of their own (Tota Roy Choudhury), and pretty soon Himmat Singh has to oversee several professional and personal crises. Not only does he lead the rescue operation, but he also has to battle an enemy nation in a cyber war that could see casualties.
