Holi pukey, it’s Chumki (Sara Ali Khan) who’s had a bit too much of festival revelry. She’s staggered into somebody else’s apartment and caught its resident Parth (Aditya Roy Kapur) in the shower. Misunderstandings ensue with her boyfriend/fiancé. Director Anurag Basu along with co-writers Samat Chakraborty and Sandeep Shrivastava zooms into the lives of four couples for an update on their status. Chumki’s sister Kajol (Konkona Sen Sharma) has stumbled upon a secret interest that husband Monty (Pankaj Tripathi) indulges in – cosy chats with other women. Not quite leading up to a full-bodied extra-marital affair, Monty’s forbidden forays are most amusing. Chunki and Kajol’s parents, Shivani (Neena Gupta) and Sanjeev (Saswata Chatterjee) have settled down in domestic comfort, the wife clearly under husband’s thumb. A class reunion that she’s been invited to will be her break-free moment especially when she steps into the life of old friend Parimal (Anupam Kher) to help him sort out a rather unusual problem he has with his widowed daughter-in-law.
