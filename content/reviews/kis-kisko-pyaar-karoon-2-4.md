You've watched Dhurandhar. You've watched Tere Ishk Mein. You've watched Haq. You wouldn't admit it, but you've also watched The Taj Story. Now you want to fold the year in peace. How about a silly Kapil Sharma comedy? I hadn't seen the trailer for Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon 2 and went in expecting more of the same: a tumescent comedy about a man with many wives, with no wars or social unrest to worry about, no particular politics to propagate. The first film, released in 2015, was some form of a hit. Surely the sequel will abide?
