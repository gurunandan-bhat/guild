Nobody expected Life in a… Metro (2007) to come from the director of Murder and Gangster. It was Anurag Basu’s first non-Vishesh Films venture after four ero-mantic (erotic+romantic) thrillers in a row. Its music composer, Pritam, was known for the chartbusters of Dhoom and Gangster. They were already commercially successful, but it never felt like they were the “makers”. More like hit-creators for hire: executors of someone else’s aesthetic. Until Metro, which became a breaking-free moment of sorts. The inspired multi-narrative drama marked the first real flex of voice for both writer-director and composer. There was a sense of exploration and discovery in the way the film unfolded — the city of Mumbai being a storyteller (with a ‘live’ band), and its many lives, the stories.
