At a railway station in a remote village, Gautam waits to pick up his brother Raman. Their mother is getting married again, and theyâ€™re running late for the festivities. Suddenly, chaos erupts when a baby named Champa is kidnapped from the station. Raman, accompanied by a snobbish and reluctant Gautam, takes it upon himself to help Jhumpa find her missing child, fighting through the chaos and uncertainty. Abhishek Banerjee, the only familiar face in the cast, delivers a credible performance in a life-and-death situation, convincingly sells his transformation to the audience.
