At the outset, let's address the ginormous elephant in the room. Dhurandhar doesn't feel as long as its runtime — three hours and 34 minutes — made it out to be. The credit for that goes to the fact that the Aditya Dhar-directed film hits the ground running and despite the protracted setup of time and space, it manages to keep its pace consistent, often escalating to breakneck speed when matters spill over into high-stakes territory. 'Break' and 'neck' are the operative words here.
