Directed by Mohit Suro, Saiyaara is a love story that seems to exist solely within the realm of cinema. Where else can you see a character stating, "Dil se banaya gaana hain, feelings hain isme" (The song is crafted from the heart, it embodies emotions) with a straight face and in all seriousness? Or lines like, "Tumse milne ke baad mera dard beh gaya" (My sorrows have washed away after meeting you), as Vani Batra expresses to Krish Kapoor.
