Rehan, a con artist, is forced by a gangster Rajan to steal a valuable diamond – The Red Sun – to save his dad. Meanwhile, Rajan’s wife, Farrah and Rehan are attracted to each other. A street-smart cop, Vikram, is on the hunt for Rehan. Rehan’s pursuit of the diamond gets trickier with time, as he tries to outsmart Rajan while dealing with his feelings for Farah. In the ultimate showdown, who has the last laugh? The hackneyed script gives the capable cast very little to work with. Saif Ali Khan looks mostly disinterested, coasting through emotional beats with his natural charm but little commitment. Jaideep Ahlawat is a major disappointment; his character and dialogues feel stuck in a bygone era of 70s cinema.
