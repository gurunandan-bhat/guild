A thriller titled ‘Blackmail’ is quite self-explanatory. Director Mu Maran’s film stays true to its name. In fact, it takes it a little too seriously. So much so that almost every character in the film blackmails someone to escape their troubles. But, the bigger question is, is ‘Blackmail’ an effective thriller as it claims to beb? Let’s find out! Mani (GV Prakash) works for a pharmaceutical distributor (Vettai Muthukumar), who also runs a secret cocaine business. One day, Mani finds out that his girlfriend, Rekha (Teju Ashwini), who works at a pharmacy, is pregnant. While she wants to abort, Mani convinces her that he will work harder to take care of her and the unborn child. Meanwhile, we are introduced to a happy family of three, headed by Ashok (Srikanth). His daughter Anu gets kidnapped by an unknown gang. There’s also Ashok’s wife Archana (Bindu Madhavi), whose ex-lover (Linga) is now planning to extort money from her. As their lives become entangled in a messy web of secrets and blackmail, chaos ensues. What happened to the kidnapped child? Who is the true villain? Why does Ashok refuse to go to police? These and more unravel over two hours.
