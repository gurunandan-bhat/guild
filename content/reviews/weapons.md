Weapons, directed and written by Zach Cregger had one of the most amazing promotional campaigns seen in this year for any film. The horror follows the story of a small town where kids ran out of their homes on their own accord never to be seen again. The trailer focused on how these kids seemed freer in the dark night running away from their families. However, the actual film is nothing close to what anyone would have expected. Visually stunning Weapons has an eerie tone to it with a background score as good as that of Nosferatu. The film begins with the narration of a small child, setting up the tone of the story as well as the situation around the incident. She reveals that one morning while the day was as ordinary as one could expect, one class had 17 kids missing. No one showed up to the class that day expect one boy Alex and the teacher Justine Gandy. While the teacher would be the usual suspect if this were a usual crime thriller, the cops and the parents in the town are baffled when ring light cameras and security details of their own homes revealed how the kids on the previous night had just run out of their homes on their own.
