A film that entertains, tugs your heart strings, addresses important societal issues and retains the feel-good factor, has become increasingly rare in Bollywood. Even though it is a remake of the 2018 Spanish film Champions (which also had a Hollywood remake with Woody Harrelson, a few years later) Sitaare Zameen Par, with all its highs and lows, manages to come out triumphant.
