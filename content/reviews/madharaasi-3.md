After a series of underwhelming misfires, Madharaasi brings back glimpses of a forgotten AR Murugadoss that had made him our top commercial movie director. This isn’t just because he still has it in him to stage elaborately choreographed, neatly cut action blocks. This isn’t because he knows how to pander to a star’s fan base and still make a film relatively entertaining to the star-agnostic. The reason Murugadoss remains a brand is because he continues to have the ability to sell you a far-fetched high concept that sounds outlandish, but without allowing you to think of just how impossible all of it is. In Madharaasi, this includes a setup that tells you that six containers filled with the latest guns are just one toll gate away from entering Tamil Nadu. Fifteen minutes later, he sells you another concept, this time about Raghu (Sivakarthikeyan), a man who suffers from delusions after he witnessed his entire family getting charred to death as a child. But instead of using this just as his backstory, the PTSD has given Raghu superpowers, the sort that let him take on a tiny army when triggered.
