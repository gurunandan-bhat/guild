Much before Nayanthara, who is now called Lady Superstar, it was Anushka Shetty who first earned the title. She headlined female-led films and created a market for such stories. But, after ‘Baahubali’, Anushka Shetty has been struggling with her film choices. As the end credits suggest, The Queen – Anushka Shetty is back with another offering with ‘Ghaati’. But does the Krish Jagarlamudi directorial gift her the much-needed comeback? Sheelavathi (Anushka Shetty) is a bus conductor in Koraput, while her childhood sweetheart Desi Raju (Vikram Prabhu), works as a lab technician. The couple live a simple life, but their past isn’t as simple as they look. Meanwhile, two cannabis business tycoons, Kundala Naidu (Chaitanya Rao) and Kaastala Naidu (Ravindra Vijay), discovert a new form of liquid-based cannabis being smuggled and are determined to secure it. This leads them to the Ghaatis, a community inhabiting the Ghats, who act as local porters helping smuggle cannabis across the mountains. Sheelavathi and Desi Raju’s past is intertwined with Kundala and Kaastala’s dream. This sets the stage for a face-off, a tale of exploitation, oppression and revenge.
