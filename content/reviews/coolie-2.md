2025 has been an unusual year for spectacle films (barring a few, of course), not just in Kollywood, but across the industry. ‘Coolie’, one of the most hyped films of 2025, with an amazing ensemble cast, was marketed as what could be the next big outing this year. It had every single ingredient to make it the next pan-India biggie. Director with an impeccable record - check. Rajinikanth - check. A diverse star cast. Check. The film spans multiple timelines and locations. Rajasekhar’s (Sathyaraj) death leaves his elder daughter Preethi (Shruti Haasan), and her two sisters struggling. His long-time friend Deva (Rajinikanth), who runs a mansion house, comes to pay his last respects, but Preethi lashes out and asks him to get out. Days later, Deva finds out that there is more to Rajasekhar’s death than meets the eye.
