In light of the tremendous success of Kantara (2022), it was inevitable that another film would follow. Kantara: Chapter 1 serves as a prequel and is characterized by its larger scale, and heightened ambition. With a runtime of nearly 3 hours, the filmmakers have opted for a grand approach, and as a visual experience, Chapter 1 certainly delivers. However, it does feel somewhat excessive and might have benefited from a more trimmed version, but then it is what it is.
