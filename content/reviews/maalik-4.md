+++

Rajkummar Rao's film is an action drama that falls into the same trap of several other releases from the same genre. The film has very little uniqueness to offer as compared to other OTT films and shows based in the same region, with similar dialogues, political issues with violence at the center of it all. From Mirzapur to now Panchayat, Maalik fits right in, without much setting it apart, other than Rajkummar Rao's performance. But the film's violence heavy screenplay leaves little focus on his emotional moments. Maalik begins with Rajkummar Rao's character Deepak punishing and killing a police officer for stopping his trucks at a check point. Without wasting much time, the filmmaker clears the air about who the film will follow and how the events will take place. For the next 30 minutes the makers focused on the political environment of Allahabad and how Maalik intends to make a space for himself.
