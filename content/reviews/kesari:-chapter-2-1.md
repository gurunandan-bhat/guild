A day before Kesari Chapter 2 was released in theatres, the film’s leading hero, Akshay Kumar, who plays Sir C Sankaran Nair in the film, urged the media at the film’s premiere to not miss the film's beginning. While Kumar has a point since the first scene depicts the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in great detail- which serves as the backdrop of this courtroom drama, it still is a difficult scene to watch. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre has been represented in books, films, and poems for years now. The tragedy shook the Indian conscience back then and till date continues to be one of the biggest blunders that the British committed while they ruled over our country. Director Karan Singh Tyagi’s film Kesari Part 2 highlights the incidents that followed the massacre and how a certain anglicized advocate who had received Knighthood for his pro-British work changed sides and spoke up against the brutality.
