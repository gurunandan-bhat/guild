A mom allows her nine-year-old daughter her first-ever sleepover at the home of her new friend in school. When she lands up the next afternoon to pick her up, her world falls apart when she discovers that her daughter has vanished, with no trace of the family that supposedly lived there. That is the rather intriguing premise of The Stolen Girl, a pulpy, if often incongruous thriller, that relies a lot on convenience and contrivance, but is engaging while it lasts. Playing out on Jio Hotstar over five pacy episodes, The Stolen Girl is akin to a page turner, a trifle sensationalist if you may, tracing how the seemingly perfect lives of Elisa Blix (Denise Gough), a high-flying stewardess, and her lawyer husband Fred (Jim Sturgess) come to a standstill when their nine-year-old daughter Lucia is kidnapped. The police are pressed into action, even as red herrings — a ransom note, Fred's brief affair, Elisa's predilection to document every aspect of her life on social media — are strewn all through the narrative. It is good fun while it lasts, but The Stolen Girl — Eva Husson directs an adaptation by Catherine Moulton of the 2020 Alex Dahl-written novel Playdate — sacrifices its potential to become yet another series that doesn't know what to do with its material after the initial episodes.
