It's not hyperbole to call Andor the best Star Wars series. Since the franchise has shifted to web series, Tony Gilroy's prequel saga is the richest telling from the galaxy, as it explores themes and arcs that seem far, far away but are more timely than one can imagine. Led by a fantastic ensemble cast, Andor Season 2 is a wonderful return to form for the franchise as the series hurtles towards the events of the feature film Rogue One (2016). Picking up one year later, Bix (Adria Arjona) and Cassian (Diego Luna) have long left Ferrix, but there are new battles to fight. Senator Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) prepares for the wedding of her teenage daughter while dealing with unexpected hitches in her secret fight against the Empire. Dedra (Denise Gough) and Syril (Kyle Soller) meet his mother, while Rogue One's Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) presents a disturbing plan to a select few. There are several plots bubbling, and each one leads us to the inevitable mission from the film.
