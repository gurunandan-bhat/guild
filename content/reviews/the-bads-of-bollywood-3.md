For someone who rarely (if at all) cracks a smile, Aryan Khan does have a wicked sense of humour. Swinging wildly between spoof, satire, self-referential and self-awareness is Shah Rukh Khan's son's directorial debut The Ba\*\*\*ds of Bollywood. Playing out over seven episodes, this Netflix series is a cheeky, and in parts courageous, look at the bad, mad, rad world of Hindi cinema that the 27-year-old Khan scion has grown up in. The workings of Bollywood, including what transpires on its fringes, has been explored and presented in various ways in the past. More recent examples include the incisive ticking time-bomb approach of Zoya Akhtar's excellent debut film Luck By Chance, and the historically sweeping semi-biographical treatment adopted by Vikramaditya Motwane in his immensely watchable web series Jubilee. The Ba\*\*\*ds of Bollywood — while borrowing a bit from both and others in the genre — takes the informed decision of veering more towards Farah Khan's wildly entertaining Om Shanti Om, a film headlined by SRK, that both spoofed Bollywood and celebrated it.
