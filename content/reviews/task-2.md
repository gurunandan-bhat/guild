Created by Brad Ingelsby of Mare of Easttown, the show follows a simple crime thriller, but only on the surface. The way the characters in the seven part series are explored is the real story within the plot. Task is about an FBI agent in the working-class suburbs of Philadelphia trailing a string of violent robberies. Before the gangs in the area start taking credit and the cops have a turf war on their hands, Special Agent Tom Brandis (Mark Ruffalo) is sent out on the scene to bring things under control. Task begins with a grieving family man, Robbie, played by Tom Pelphrey. Raising two kids without their mother, Robbie wants a better life for his family and knows he won't be able to do it if things stay the way they are. The only one by his side is his work friend, Cliff and his niece, Maeve. She is the one usually taking care of the kids and is unhappy with how unreliable Robbie is as a father. But Robbie has plans of his own to make sure his kids are taken care of, no matter the cost.
