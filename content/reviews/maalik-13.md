Another gangster film, you ask? Yawn… stretch… cue eye-roll? Well, hold that sigh! Because Maalik isn’t just another entry in the long line of blood-splattered, dialogue-heavy desi crime sagas. This time, it's Rajkummar Rao—yes, our usually understated poster boy for indie angst—getting absolutely ripped and unleashing his inner baddie, all while juggling social commentary like it’s part of a gym circuit. Directed by Pulkit, Maalik is set in Allahabad, in the turbulent years between 1988 and 1990—a time when moustaches were thick, tempers were thicker, and justice was mostly served with a hockey stick. Rao plays Deepak, a humble farmer’s son whose slide into the underworld is triggered by the usual recipe: a cocktail of caste-based humiliation, wounded family pride, and a healthy dose of "Why should I till the land when I can rule it instead?"
