The Khatu family gathers for Dinushet’s last rituals, each with hidden agendas concerning their ancestral home. As young Sayali senses a ghostly presence, the mystery of Dinushet’s death unfolds amidst family arguments. Secrets of Manoj and Shalaka are revealed. Nayana and jewels vanish. Sayali befriends a spirit. Is it too late before Kartik and Madhavi realise the mastermind behind the murders? Kishor Kadam is undeniably the show-stealer in Andhar Maya, with his superb screen presence gradually building an element of mystery, even though the writing isn’t always sharp. Among the other actors, Rutuja Bagwe and Shubhangi Bhujbal make an impression within the limitations of their roles. Anup Belwalkar, Shubhankar Tawde, and Omprakash Shinde deliver decent performances. The child artist, Pihu Gosavi, also manages to shine in a few moments.
