Andor returned for season 2 earlier this week with the bleak future for the Rebels and the Empire. The show explores the political implications of the war between the Empire and the Rebels as they struggle to take hold on the galaxy. Instead of the usual good verses evil, the series explores a more deeper look into what went down as we see the personal journey of some Rebels, different versions of Rebels as well as the proceedings of how the Empire began to take control of the senate. The season beings with one end goal in mind, aka the Battle of Yavin. Beginning 4 years before the battle, the show follows the course of actions that lead to the establishment of rebel forces on Yavin and the consequences of Empire's growing power across the galaxy. While some Senators are seen fighting for the rights of the people, other are seen working with the Empire to save their backs. Meanwhile different wars brew across the galaxy, with rebels taking charge on different planets to fight against the Empire.
