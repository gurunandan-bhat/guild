Shashank Khaitan’s Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari feels like a film that’s already over before it begins. The title practically spoils its own ending. What we experience is a 135-minute journey which is more of a decorative detour than a meaningful ride. Packed with lavish costumes, picturesque Udaipur, endless pre-wedding functions, than one can count, this is the kind of movie that dazzles the eyes but barely stirs emotions. Khaitan and producers Dharma have embraced what one could call ‘wedding album cinema’—opulent sets, attractive costumes and meticulous staging. High on style, but low on logic or storyline.
