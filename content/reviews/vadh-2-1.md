The arrival of Keshav (Aksshay Dogra) who picks up two cute puppies, is such a fine piece of writing that even before he utters a word, you hate him. You want to kill him. The writing, along with direction that’s in complete control of every character and every situation, makes Jaspal Singh Sandhu’s second outing with Shambhunath Mishra (Sanjay Mishra) and Manju Singh (Neena Gupta) an intriguing watch as details come out in trickles. Sandhu and co-writer Neha Shitole begin with a preamble set in 1994. A young woman is sentenced for a double murder. No words spoken by her.
