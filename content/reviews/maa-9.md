Coming-of-age enthusiasts used to accuse Imtiaz Ali of telling one story over and over again. Lapsed horror enthusiasts like myself might accuse director Vishal Furia of being in the same boat. His latest, Maa (“mother”), is supposed to share a universe with Vikas Bahl’s Shaitaan (2024), but it’s actually Furia’s Chhorii 2 (which released in April) on a backpacking trip across West Bengal. Both movies feature a single mom from a city having to defy the demonic forces of an ancestral village to protect her girl-child. The daughter’s sacrifice (and first period) holds the key to uncurse the place. If the supernatural offender was a Tumbbad-coded prehistoric creature in Chhori 2, Maa’s baddie is a needy tree monster who looks a lot like Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy. I could swear that the haunted Banyan tree in Maa — beset with the cries of slaughtered babies — is the one from last month’s The Bhootnii. The visual effects are better, but I’m not sure that’s a good thing anymore. Maa stars Kajol as the titular parent who must transform into Goddess Kali to defeat the sinister descendant of the Raktabija. It takes two hours to set up this face-off, becoming yet another notch in the belt of a film industry that keeps staging supernatural tales about feminism and empowerment (the Hindi titles have exhausted all variations of “woman,” “mother,” “daughter” and “girl”) to offset the performative ironies of the natural world — in this case, a country notoriously unsafe for the female form. Maa overcompensates to a point where it’s hard to tell fantasy from reality.
