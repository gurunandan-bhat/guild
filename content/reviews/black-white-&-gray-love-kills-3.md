The six-part series Black, White & Gray - Love Kills looks at a string of murders by a young man in suspicious circumstances and tries to peel back the layers of the alleged truth. The crime thriller by Pushkar Mahabal takes a unique approach by dissecting the story into a dramatisation and a documentary. It decides to be impartial and present the versions of the 'truth' to viewers, letting them decide. However, the storytelling twists work only up until a point, and dual perspectives may leave some confused. A faceless British journalist named Daniel Gray (voice of Edward Sonnenblick) is piecing together the story of a trail of murders in Maharashtra after a young couple goes missing. The young woman (Palak Jaiswal) is the daughter of a powerful politician (Anant Jog), while the young man (Mayur More) is the son of his driver. From the parents of the couple to innocent bystanders-turned-victims in the crime spree, the story looks at how the young man becomes the scapegoat of the whole affair. But at every point, there's just enough leeway to make you doubt each version of the 'truth' we are seeing.
