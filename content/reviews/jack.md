In the Telugu film Jack, written and directed by Bhaskar of Bommarillu fame, there is a recurring reference to how the protagonist, Jack, aka Pablo Neruda (played by Siddhu Jonnalagadda), was rejected by 24 coaches in his childhood for being an overenthusiastic child who lacked the discipline to train in any sport or art form. Perhaps the number 24 is a nod to the 24 crafts of cinema — we will never know. The story follows this misfit, who, with an uncanny sense of humour, positions himself as a self-appointed agent operating parallel to RAW (Research and Analysis Wing), determined to foil a terror plot. If the premise sounds unconvincing, the narrative unfolds in a way that makes it even harder to buy into. The title Jack, a metaphor for ‘jack of all trades’, leans heavily on its lead actor’s charisma and comic timing to sell an erratic character. Siddhu shoulders the film, delivering one-liners with flair and embodying both the angst and ambition of his role. But it is in vain, as the script remains flawed.
