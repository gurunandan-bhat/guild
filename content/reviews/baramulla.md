Baramulla opens with a striking single shot: a solitary flower bud in the snow attracts the attention of a child named Shoaib. It’s the sort of shot that usually ends with the sound of a bullet and the image of blood splattered across the whiteness. It is Kashmir after all. But the camera floats above the valley as the spell breaks and he trudges into the background. Minutes later, he disappears during a local magic show. Hard-nosed DSP Ridwaan Sayyed (Manav Kaul) is summoned to this town to crack the case and locate Shoaib, the son of a former MLA. Ridwaan’s track is rooted in the normal — more kids disappear from the same school, and the film shows a band of militants (led by a faceless mastermind named “Bhaijaan”) behind these kidnappings.
