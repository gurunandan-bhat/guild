The sixth film in the martial arts franchise that debuted in 1984, Karate Kid: Legends flings open the dojo doors to deliver chops, blocks, and kicks in a nostalgic throwback for fans of the Karate Kid movies. This latest entry, a legacy sequel, deftly combines former franchise stars, elements from the last five films, and updated threads from the Cobra Kai television series, while introducing a new Chinese lead in a familiar underdog-turned-hero arc. But the tropes remain the same. The underdog journey of Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) in 1984’s The Karate Kid—waxing on and off under Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita)—is mirrored in a contemporary New York setting, where Chinese student Li Fong must navigate a new world. The franchise has always been about mentorship, honour, and a game-changing final kick—even in the 2010 reboot with Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan, which leaned more into kung fu. Cobra Kai flipped the script, featuring Macchio as LaRusso and giving Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) a redemptive arc.
