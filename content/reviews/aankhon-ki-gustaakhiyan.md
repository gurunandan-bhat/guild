Strangers meeting on a train and falling in love has led to epic romances from Pakeezah to Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. Never though the experience has felt as bogus and bizarre as Saba and Jahaan's blind encounter in Aankhon Ki Gustaakhiyan. Directed by Santosh Singh for a script 'created' by Mansi Bagla, the farfetched premise inspired by Ruskin Bond's short story The Eyes Have It, revolves around Saba (Shanaya Kapoor), a blindfolded theatre actress eyeing Bollywood stardom and Jahaan (Vikrant Massey), a sightless songwriter traveling from Delhi to Dehradun on a train with a VFX view. Whatever poetic allusions the makers want to build on what it means to see or feel through the eyes of one's soul are lost in the sheer senselessness of the plot.
