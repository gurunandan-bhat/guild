An intensive search-and-combing operation which results in the capture of a dreaded terrorist in Srinagar could be the one-line theme of several similar films in the past. The difference with ‘Ground Zero’, which calls itself a ‘work of fiction based on real-life events’, are two-fold. First, it releases the same week of the Pahalgam tragedy, whose consequences will be felt for a long time to come. Second, it steers clear of the disturbing jingoism that has been part and parcel of such films, focussing instead on the tough life of the BSF jawans and other security forces in the conflict-stricken Kashmir valley Emran Hashmi plays BSF officer Narendra Nath Dhar Dubey, who managed to locate and take out terrorist kingpin Ghazi Baba and his accomplices in 2003. It was a time when PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee had visited the valley, in the midst of rising terrorist activities: there are glimpses of the 2001 attack on Parliament in the film.
