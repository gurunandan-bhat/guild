On paper, a woman as a sexual predator sounds rather exciting as a theme. And when that part of a woman accused of sexual transgression is being played by Konkona Sensharma, a gifted actor with chameleon-like malleability, the interest touches another level. In the first few scenes, her abilities as a skilled gynaecologist Dr Geetika are established and her acting chops are on ample display too. The focus shifts to her home where her married partner is a woman, Meera, also a doctor. The beautiful Pratibha Rannta of ‘Laapataa Ladies’ is back and stuns as much in this modern avatar. Yes, we know, same-sex marriages are not allowed in India. The setting here, by the way, is London, where this couple lives and works and is planning to adopt a child.
