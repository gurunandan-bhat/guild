There are a lot of familiar themes in the Game of Thrones (GOT) spinoff, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. Based on the Dunk and Egg novellas from George RR Martin, the six-part series follows a different kind of hero, a hedge knight named Dunk, who wants to make a name for himself. This is the story of the gentle giant who goes on to become Ser Duncan the Tall (Peter Claffey) and his trusty squire Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell). Created by Martin and Ira Parker, the HBO series stands out from the other shows in this world, GOT and House of the Dragon. What makes A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms more appealing is its story of the underdog who goes up against the noblest names in the kingdom. This tale of valour and honor will immediately grab attention.
