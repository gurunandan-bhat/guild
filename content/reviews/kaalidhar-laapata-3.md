Madhumita’s Kaalidhar Laapata ('Kaalidhar is lost') is a Hindi adaptation of the director’s Tamil drama, K.D. (2019). But in terms of mainstream Bollywood, it has more in common with that evergreen Indian-parent bible, Baghban (2003). The story of an old, unwanted patriarch finding purpose and belonging away from his greedy family in K.D. is remodelled into the tale of a middle-aged, dementia-afflicted man on the same journey. This bearded and disoriented character, Kaalidhar, is played by Abhishek Bachchan, further supplying the film’s status as a spiritual descendant of the Amitabh Bachchan starrer. Kaalidhar’s ungrateful brothers ‘accidentally’ lose him in a crowd; the identity-less man then befriends an eight-year-old orphan, Ballu (Daivik Baghela), and they embark on a fix-it adventure together. It’s a familiar template: childlike man and adult-like child forge an inevitable bond. It has a few worthy ideas. For instance, the brothers' ploy to get rid of Kaalidhar features a packed ‘kumbh mela’ — vintage Hindi cinema’s go-to location for plots revolving around separated siblings. Given the man’s neurological condition, there’s no need for him to literally overhear their plan; the heartbreaking shot of Kaalidhar calling out to his brother only to realise he’s being ignored is enough.
