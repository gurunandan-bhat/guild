The zombies have returned following a significant hiatus. Although it did not initially present itself as a zombie series in 2001 with 28 Days Later, it gradually evolved into one. Director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland stepped away from their respective positions for the sequel 28 Weeks Later (2007), but they have returned for 28 Years Later, a stylishly crafted post-apocalyptic thriller.
