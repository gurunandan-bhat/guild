“The world doesn’t exist in binary, it’s f**\***g unreasonable,” says Madhavan in one of the important scenes in ‘Test’. This statement stands as a testament to all the characters in the world of the film. In retrospect, it also defines everyone’s life. A person is not just black and white, they have all shades of grey. 'Test' explains this well in dealing with the lives of Arjun, Saravanan and Kumudha over two hours and 25 minutes. Kumudha (Nayanthara) is a teacher, a housewife, who supports her husband Saravanan (Madhavan). Sara, who claims to run a canteen, is also trying to get his alternate fuel technology project sanctioned by the government. Meanwhile, there’s cricketer Arjun Venkatraman (Siddharth), an out-of-form batsman, who is looking at playing the iconic India vs Pakistan test match in Chepauk, which could be his last match. There are also local people involved in match fixing based on orders from the syndicate head. The police officials are acting on a tip-off from sources about match-fixing. During the crucial match, Kumudha, Saravanan and Arjun’s lives converge, making for an intense drama about right and wrong.
