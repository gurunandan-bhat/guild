Ever found yourself watching a horror movie and thinking: “Man, the dog knows something we don’t”? If so, then the Good Boy horror movie is tailor-made for you. Helmed by debutant Ben Leonberg, it’s a genuinely fresh spin on the genre. It is told from a narrator who barks (well, mostly whines) instead of speaking and wags instead of walking away. (And yes, your dog will now stare at random corners for entirely justified reasons.) Let’s dive into the Good Boy horror movie story and ending, which are both explained here.
