Draped in myth, dread, ghosts, and matriarchal rage, Maa isn’t your typical “mom fights for child” drama. It’s Kali Puja meets folk horror, with just enough gore and generational trauma. It sort of makes you question whether moving back to your ancestral village is ever a good idea. Maa movie throws itself headfirst into this jungle of ritual and revenge, with Kajol leading like a woman who’s read one too many ancient scriptures. Let’s dive deeper into the Maa movie, its story and ending, both of which are explained here, the cast, and more. On the surface, the Maa movie begins like a dark fable, twin births, secret killings, bad omens, and temples that only open when the Doddess visits you in dreams. But what it slowly morphs into is a full-blown indictment of patriarchal traditions dressed up as divine will. Through the story of Shweta and her mother Ambika (Kajol), the film lures us into Chandrapur’s cursed soil, where young girls go missing, demonic trees thirst for blood, and the real monsters are men disguised as protectors. Kajol’s character, equal parts devoted mother and accidental final girl, must go toe-to-toe with ancient evil, aided only by visions and old manuscripts.
