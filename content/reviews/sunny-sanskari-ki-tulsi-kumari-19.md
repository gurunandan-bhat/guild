Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari is more like a sitcom written by a Dharma committee than a proper movie. We discuss Varun Dhawan’s seemingly stagnant evolution as an actor, Janhvi Kapoor moving in the opposite direction, and Sanya Malhotra and Rohit Saraf happily accepting the paycheque. We also talk about the film’s incoherent narrative, unimaginative plot, and strange lack of confidence.
