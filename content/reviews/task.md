Since its release in 2021, so many makers have tried to replicate the moody and twisty narrative of Mare of Easttown, which starred Kate Winslet. Creator Brad Ingelsby's latest show, Task, borrows many elements from his own award-winning series, and the result is a taut thriller that leaves you guessing until the last episode. The seven-part series gives viewers two protagonists to empathise with; they are headed on a crash course from which there is no return. Mark Ruffalo plays FBI agent Tom Brandis, who heads a task force to look into a string of violent robberies that target drug and gang houses. As he and his team dive deeper and deeper into the case, they uncover betrayals and moles that have wider repercussions. Meanwhile, main suspect Robbie Prendergast (Tom Pelphrey) is bottling up intense emotions that could land him and his family in deep trouble. Will both men make it out to the other side alive?
