Incredible, incredulous and invigorating… indeed you expect no less, perhaps no more too, from the Mission Impossible franchise. Ever since Tom Cruise landed on our theatre screens in 1996 as Ethan Hunt, he and his insanely successful franchise have captured viewers’ imagination like fire. The fact that India is one of the few countries where the film released before its US outing in theatres is proof enough of its burgeoning Indian fandom. Indeed, the template of the actioner is the same. Impossible we all know is not just another word in the title of the MI universe, it’s the key driver and mantra where the implausibility of it all is what makes it exciting. Those who have seen the prequel Mission Impossible: The Dead Reckoning, know too well who Ethan’s enemy and world’s is, this time over. In a way his job is cut out, and the very first scene establishes so. Indeed, it’s the ‘Entity’ who has taken control of the nuclear arsenal of most countries including India and Pakistan. In another time nuclear threat hovering over our heads may have seemed like a distant nightmare.
