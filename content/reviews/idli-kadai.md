Dhanush, as an actor and director, has a strong track record of producing heartwarming family dramas. From 'Velaiyilla Pattadhari' to 'Thiruchitrambalam', many films from his filmography have that recall value that makes for a perfect weekend watch. Dhanush is now back with 'Idli Kadai', his fourth directorial venture that promises another solid drama packed with emotions.
