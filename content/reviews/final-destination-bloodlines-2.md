Directed by Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein, the franchise returns with a fresh perspective and many nostalgic moments. Titled Final Destination Bloodlines, the film brings forth exactly what it promises with the title and the trailer. The story is pretty simple and follows through with every other film in the franchise, but the direction and screenplay get a major upgrade. The film takes you from cheering for the characters, rooting for them to surive to cheering for death and fullfilling his own destiny by taking everyone out.
