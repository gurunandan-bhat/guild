Logically, a sequel ought to be bigger and better, a feat rarely achieved. Indeed, ‘Raid 2’ ups the scale on the execution front. But in terms of treatment, as it tries to marry the realistic with the dramatic, it is a tough balancing act. From the ‘No One Killed Jessica’ director Raj Kumar Gupta, who directed the prequel ‘Raid’ too, you do not expect the same old wine in a new bottle. If we lauded ‘Raid’, based on a real-life incident, for fleshing out a full-fledged movie out of an income-tax raid, ‘Raid 2’ can’t possibly be just more of the same. For, how much surprise can you pack in the crevices of where and how the corrupt hide their money?
