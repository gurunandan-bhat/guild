Sanskrit teacher Shrirenu Tripathi (R Madhavan) is unhappily single at 42. He nearly loses hope of settling down until he is introduced to 32-year-old Madhu Bose (Fatima Sana Shaikh), a pretty girl proficient in French. He lives in Jamshedpur; she in Kolkata. Despite their age gap, contrasting personality and mindset, they hit it off. An arranged marriage evolving into love seems likely but there’s more to their story than meets the eye. While he’s over the moon to have finally found a companion who loves him just as deeply, a nagging fear still lingers. Why would someone as beautiful, young, and accomplished as Madhu fall for someone like him? What could she possibly see in him? His fear turns into reality when ahead of their marriage, he discovers the two have a past. The movie begins on a promising note. A single man in his 40’s, believing in old school romance is ashamed of being a virgin because society feels so. For the modern world, he is abnormal, an awkward loser, who needs to do something about his situation because there’s no way he can be happy. Madhu on the contrary, is liberal and wonders why anyone would expect women to be virgins today. Their match feels doomed from the beginning until they find a common ground amid the chaos and moral conflict.
