Kesari Veer: Legend of Somnath isn’t shy about what it wants to be. It’s a full-throated, slow-motion-laden ode to sacrifice set against the backdrop of 14th-century Gujarat. The film reconstructs the tale of Hamirji Gohil — likely a historical figure about whom not much is known beyond legends and folktales. But once the dust settles (and the background score finally fades), what does the ending actually mean? This is your Kesari Veer movie story and ending explained, and also learn about the cast of the movie, trailer, and more. The Kesari Veer movie is something of a historical epic account with an eye on a cultural assertion. It is stylised to a pitch of crescendo. It occasionally can stray beyond historical consensus — that, I would say, has never really been unusual in Bollywood. I mean, Chhaava was pretty recent and had its hero chucking a shield at the enemy like Captain America. At the heart of the Kesari Veer story is a man standing in the path of an invading army and an important Lord Shiva temple (Somnath).
