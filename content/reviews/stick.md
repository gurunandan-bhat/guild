It's no Ted Lasso, but the new Apple TV+ comedy Stick is sentimental and sickly sweet in its redemption story about a former golfer finding his mojo again through mentoring a teen phenom. Owen Wilson's earnest performance salvages the dramedy about found family, grief, and, of course, golf. Owen Wilson is Pryce Cahill, a former golf pro who now works in a store and gives lessons. Cahill, nicknamed Stick, has had a hard couple of years after the death of his four-year-old son. Divorced and directionless, he makes some cash on the side hustling unsuspecting patrons in bars along with his caddy, Mitts (Marc Maron). That all changes after he spots teenager Santiago Wheeler (Peter Dager) hitting on the green. It energises him, and he believes the young man has the potential to become the next Tiger Woods.
