Arjun, a father to a school-going son Aadi and a cricket star on the wane, grabs a spot in a crucial match against Pakistan amidst much resistance from selectors and the public. His childhood sweetheart Kumudha, who yearns to raise a child, leads a quiet life with Saravanan, an MIT product who struggles to get his career going. When his son goes missing, Arjun needs to choose between cricket and family. Siddarth, essaying a sportsman who handles edgy conflicts on and off the field, delivers a nuanced, mature performance truly indicative of his potential as a performer. Yet, time and again, you feel sad that his choices continue to fail his talents. The unusual casting choice to pair him up opposite Meera Jasmine is interesting, though the latter deserved a better-etched part.
