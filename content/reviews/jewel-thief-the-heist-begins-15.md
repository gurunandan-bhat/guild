Jewel Thief directed by Kookie Gulati, Robbie Grewal explores the story of a heist with both partners trying to one up each other. However, the thief best known for his skills ends up winning the loot and the girl. Led by Jaideep as the bad boy and Saif Ali Khan as the good hearted thief, the film doesn't have anything new to offer, in terms of comedy, music, direction or story line. The story takes itself too seriously, border lining Dhoom, Sikander and Race franchises. The film beings with Rajan Aulakh's introduction as the bad boy who is rich, acquires art, paintings and occasionally likes to dabble into painting himself, with the blood of his enemies. We never find out much about what he does, but his illegal accounts are ceased by Interpol and to get the money back to his clients he needs to find a new way. His way is none other then getting in touch with a well known Jewel Thief, Rehan Roy played by Saif Ali Khan. By blackmailing his family, Rajan finds a way to get in touch with Rehan in Budapest.
