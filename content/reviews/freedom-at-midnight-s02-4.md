Clueless Sir Cyril Radcliffe calmly cut his steak on the flight out of India, leaving behind a nation he’d just carved into two. Louis Mounbatten (Luke McGibney) became India’s first Governor-General, content that the Partition had happened without spilling a drop of British blood. But what about Indian blood, his wife countered. Jinnah (Arif Zakaria) crowned himself Qaed-e-Azam, tore himself from beloved Bombay to settle down in Karachi, hid his illness which, if made public, may not have led to a new Muslim country, and ego-butted Mountbatten as his equal in rank. With sister Fatima (Ira Dubey) as his ally all the way.
