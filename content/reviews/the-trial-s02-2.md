It has been two years since the inaugural season of The Trial released. It is a remake of American legal drama The Good Wife. Like the first season, The Trial season 2 is also something of a thriller with multiple twists and turns. Let’s probe into The Trial season 2 web series story and ending, which are explained here, the fate of Noyonika, the character played by Kajol, and more. Much of season 2 of this legal thriller revolves around the fallout from the season 1. As you know (and if you don’t perhaps watch the first season before reading this), Noyonika’s husband Rajiv (Jisshu Sengupta) was involved in what we call a ‘sex scandal’, which is Indiaspeak for having an affair and then being discovered by the general public. Noyonika had been out of the work force for quite some time and had to take a job with a law firm thanks to her old law school friend Vishal (Alyy Khan), who is also a partner.
