After premiering in November 2024 on SonyLIV, Freedom at Midnight has returned to pick up the story after independence was announced for India and Pakistan by the British Raj. The historical drama, created by Nikkhil Advani, is more thoughtful and poignant in this second season as the emotional impact of the Partition hits you deep. Backed by a strong cast and excellent writing, Freedom at Midnight takes viewers right in to the heart of creating the two neighbouring nations and the toll it created for the citizens, then and now.
