It’s perhaps no coincidence that Julia Fox has a cameo in Night Always Comes, the new thriller on Netflix starring Vanessa Kirby. Modelled on the movies of the Safdie brothers, Night Always Comes stares more than just a structure with Uncut Gems, in which Fox played a memorable cameo. That ticking timebomb thriller followed a desperate New York jeweller weaponising his gambling addiction in a breakneck attempt to gather cash. It was a movie that a third-act basketball match into a life-and-death scenario. In Night Always Comes, Kirby plays a working class woman staring at sure-shot eviction if she isn’t able to come up with a $25,000 deposit in one night.
