Trust Malayalam cinema to come up with a fairly ingenious multiverse rooted in Indian folktales and legends in Lokah Chapter 1, and trust the makers to have the protagonist as a kickass superheroine in Chandra (Kalyani Priyadarsan). Inspired by Yakshi, an enigmatic, powerful female figure from Kerala folklore, director and co-writer Dominic Arun turns her into a vampire with red tresses and on a mission to do the right thing. Survival is dependent on a regular supply of blood, living in the shadows and biting into baddies the world over for centuries. Once in Bengaluru, Chandra catches the wandering eye of Sunny (Naslen), who lives in a building opposite hers. Thankfully, love is not high on the cards of Lokah. Instead, the film impresses with its world and character-building as Arun focuses on a wonder woman with a tragic past and one whose mission—at least in her new home—is to smash the patriarchy.
