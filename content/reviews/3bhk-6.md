This is the kind of movie that is made with the certainty that it would strike a chord with the middle class and their struggles. “Nalla relate aagum" (It would be very relatable) would have been the feedback about the film at every stage of its making. The bet is all on creating the feeling in the viewer that one is seen, heard or represented. By doing so, filmmaker Sri Ganesh portrays the life of the class as nothing but struggle, stripped of any joy, and the viewer feels the same. 3BHK is the story of a father named Vasudevan (Sarathkumar), struggling to buy his own house. However, every time he gets closer to his dream, the finish line moves further. The entire family is on a mission to buy a 3BHK and move out of their rented house in a cramped complex. A chart is stuck on the living room wall with the goal amount for their dream. Vasudevan’s son Prabhu (Siddharth) faces financial pressure, making him fail in his academic pursuits. Despite his relentless efforts, he manages to clear his board exams only with ‘just pass’ marks. A management seat in a reputed engineering college for Prabhu costs the family more years to reach their goal. Then it’s a heart attack, then the wedding of Vasudevan’s daughter Aarthy (Chaithra), and then something else. By then, we understand the film’s intent and where it is heading.
