Like most projects in Hollywood these days, the new film in the Tron franchise, Tron: Ares, asks if Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used for good. Joachim Rønning's feature brings forth some new characters wrestling with the idea of big tech harnessing AI for their own benefits. The franchise also returns back to the grid in both nostalgic and futuristic ways. The sequel sits on the fence, making its narrative appealing for fans and newcomers looking for an entertaining watch in theatres.
