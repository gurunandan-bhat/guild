I have to admit I’ve had the Marvel Superhero fatigue for a while now and have even avoided watching some of the studio’s recent offerings. There are too many now, and everything seems to be having an Avengers hangover. Just when I was about to write off Marvel Cinematic Universe, the studio has sprung a surprise with Thunderbolts- a film that is aware of the weight of fatigue that it carries but turns the Avengers sub plot on its head and delivers a refreshing take on the super hero world post the exit of the Marvel stalwarts. The film, directed by Jack Shreier and featuring Sebastian Stan, Florence Pugh and others, also tackles mental health in the most effective way possible in a story of reluctant, has-been superheroes.
