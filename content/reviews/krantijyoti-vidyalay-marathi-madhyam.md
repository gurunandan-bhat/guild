The film revolves around a 99-year-old Marathi school in Alibaug called Krantijyoti Vidyalay Marathi Madhyam. The school is everything for its Principal Shirke sir (Sachin Khedekar). But currently, the school doesn’t have any future. The state government has ordered to raze the school as, according to them, its lease period is over and the structure of the building has become weak. The plan is also to make an English medium international school in its place. This has happened to thousands of Marathi schools in Maharashtra.
