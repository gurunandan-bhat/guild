Is ‘Dhurandhar’ based on facts? Does it cover the incredible feats of the late martyr Major Mohit Sharma? Many ticklish questions have trailed the film ever since its trailer dropped. On the face of it, the story of Indian spy Hamza (Ranveer Singh) doesn’t appear to be a replica of Sharma’s life. The setting here is Lyari, a town in Karachi where gang wars ruled. Yes, the film starts with a factual event: the hijacking of an Indian plane. Indeed, Madhavan’s character of IB chief Ajay Sanyal looks suspiciously close to that of NSA Ajit Doval. There are a few more terror-related incidents which lend an authentic tone and tenor to this thriller.
