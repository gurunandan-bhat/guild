Following the releases of Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Sultan in 2015 and 2016, respectively, Salman Khan's career has faced a downward trajectory marked by a series of unsuccessful films. His popularity has waned, and the arrival of Sikander has been met with little excitement, suggesting it may also depart the same way. Despite the involvement of A.R. Murgadoss, you would expect some kind of anticipation to build up but maybe the filmmakers knew it was a lost cause.. The only positive aspect is that Sikander is not as bad as Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan (2023) Radhe (2021) or Tubelight (2017), but then that is not saying much. The standards have fallen so low in recent years that they have reached rock bottom.
