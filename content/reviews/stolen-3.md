Karan Tejpal's directorial debut, Stolen, begins in the night and ends in the day. It starts with a nightmarish scenario wherein a woman's baby is taken from her and takes viewers on a real rollercoaster ride where the fates of all the characters are up in the air. The tense crime thriller, which is inspired by true events, is a real edge-of-your-seat drama that allows you to take a breath only at the very end. Gautam (Abhishek Banerjee) goes to pick up his younger brother Raman (Shubham Vardhan) at a sparsely occupied railway station in the middle of the night. Before that, a baby is quietly whisked away from the arms of Jhumpa (Mia Maelzer). When she wakes, she suspects Raman of the deed and causes an uproar. Soon, a crowd is gathered, and it takes Gautam's interference to calm things down.
From thereon, Stolen moves from one wild moment to another as the brothers, plus Jhumpa, are questioned by the police and overzealous locals in a bid to catch the real kidnappers. As the duo digs deeper and deeper in the mess, they discover the truth is much crazier than they imagined.
