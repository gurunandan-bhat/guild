Jatadhara is an engaging, visually striking supernatural thriller that successfully merges commercial spectacle with artistic expression. It begins with a mythical narrative of how hundreds of years ago, with absence of banks or safe deposit vaults, when people used to store and hide gold and valuables beneath their homes to safeguard their hard earned wealth from dacoits. The introduction goes back and forth from the current day seminar on paranormal phenomenon and ghosts by the Indian Paranormal League where one attendee stands out declaring that he strongly believes that there are no ghosts.
