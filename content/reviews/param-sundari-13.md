Directed by Tushar Jalota, Param Sundari is a romantic comedy that possesses a very flimsy base, like a papad. This base disintegrates quickly, leading to a succession of familiar scenes that unfold over a duration of two hours. With the lingering influence of Chennai Express (2013), Param Sundari emerges as yet another narrative exploring the cultural divide between North and South, interspersed with some contrived romantic elements.
