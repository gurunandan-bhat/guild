Animation hall-of-famer Genndy Tartakovsky latest film, Fixed, was originally set for a theatrical release, but was offloaded by Warner Bros. during a cost-cutting drive. While movies such as Coyote vs. Acme and Batgirl — both were dealt similar blows — remain sight unseen, it’s easy to imagine why the studio would’ve wanted to wash the scent of Fixed off of itself. A wiser move would’ve been to bury it in the backyard. Painfully unfunny, the train wreck of a movie feels interminable at even 80 minutes long; it’s crude, cringe, and filled with juvenile dialogue that makes you feel like you’re eavesdropping on a group of 12-year-old boys at the playground.
