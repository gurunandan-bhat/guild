Samuel Umman, a businessman involved in real estate, is killed in a road accident. Antonio George, entrusted with the case, smells something fishy. An investigation into Samuel’s life leads him to a confidante, Francis. He unearths an alleged loan scam in connection with a local cooperative bank. A thug Shaji, Samuel’s own son Ebin, and a few bank employees are also under the scanner. It’s Sudev Nair and Arun Sol, who enjoy bulk of the screen-time in the show. Sudev’s past appearances in both positive/negative roles work in favour of his casting, though Arun gets better scope to deliver a portrayal with space for histrionic talents. Akhil Kavalayoor, Ajay Vasudev, and Kalfan have one-note roles, and they deliver okayish performances. The women hardly have any prominence and get to make much impact.
