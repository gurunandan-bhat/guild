Parshi, a carefree youngster, is head over heels in love with Anitha, who just can’t seem to give her consent to marriage. Sattaiah, Anitha’s father, and his younger brother Narsing Yadav remain on good terms until they discover a share of their deceased father’s land. What connects Parshi to the land, and how far will it affect his marriage prospects? Will the warring brothers mend their ways? Mothevari Love Story isn’t a show where you expect refined performances, but the young guns and a few experienced hands do what’s necessary to sustain its momentum. Anil Geela’s underdog act and easy-going persona make him instantly relatable, while Varshini Junnuthula’s crankiness as Anitha is generally charming.
