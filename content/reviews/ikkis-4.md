Not the sort of Bollywood war movie that goes all guns blazing and tom-tomming the virtues of battlefield bellicosity, Ikkis conserves its firepower and spreads it out judiciously over its two-and-a-half-hour runtime. The strategy, sustained all the way through, serves Sriram Raghavan's film, which is a marked departure from his neo-noir thrillers, well. It hits its intended targets more often than it misses.
