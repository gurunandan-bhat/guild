If you’ve ever stared at old British buildings from the colonial era that are scattered throughout hill stations such as Shimla and Mussoorie, and thought, “I bet something deeply absurd and faintly colonial is going on in there,” then Lord Curzon Ki Haveli exists to confirm your suspicions. Within minutes of the movie, we are in the territory of posh dread and psychological warfare, except this time, the ghosts are postcolonial. A mystery movie laced with dark comedy, it throws four Indians into an English countryside dinner party and watches them unravel.
