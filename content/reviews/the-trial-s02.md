This time around, there’s no sex scandal rocking the Senguptas who’ve settled down in Mumbai. In fact, there is only the past that keeps popping up like a bad penny. But there is the addition of Narayani (Sonali Kulkarni), a true-blue Maharashtrian lady politician. Throwing the outsider card at opponent Rajiv Sengupta (Jisshu Sengupta), shaming him for his gay brother-in-law’s part at a Gay Pride gathering and enjoying a concert while her raid squads create a half-hearted upheaval at the Sengupta residence, Narayani is the clear vamp of electoral rivalry. It’s good old dirty politics (nothing new out there) that overtakes shame and scandal in the family.
