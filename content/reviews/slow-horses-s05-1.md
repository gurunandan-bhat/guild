It may not get enough awards love or attention, but Slow Horses is quietly plodding on as one of the most dependable and exhilarating spy series on streaming. With Season 5 about to premiere, the sixth and seventh seasons are already in the works at Apple TV+. The fifth season brings yet another puzzle to Gary Oldman's spymaster, Jackson Lamb, who proves to the MI5 heads why he's the best they've got. With strong performances by Jack Lowden, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Saskia Reeves, the newest season is another thrilling ride. The rejected MI5 agents of Slough House get yet another opportunity to save the day and one-up the headquarters at Regentâ€™s Park. This time, a terror plot links back to one of their own, as tech guy Roddy Ho (Christopher Chung) has been honey-trapped. The British intelligence organisation gets a taste of their own medicine as potential terror incidents take place all over London, rattling those in power. It's up to Lamb and his underutilised and underarmed team of 'rejected' spies to step in with their wits to avoid a larger catastrophe.
