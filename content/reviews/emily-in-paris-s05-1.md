The American fashionista Emily Cooper is back, and this time, she's setting up base in Rome, Italy. Au revoir Paris? Not quite yet. The Netflix series Emily in Paris returns for a fifth season that once again puts our favourite bunch of Parisians through the ringer. There are hookups and breakups, goodbyes and hellos as the characters have some big life decisions to ponder. Created by Darren Star, the romantic comedy has settled in, only to reinvent itself yet again.
