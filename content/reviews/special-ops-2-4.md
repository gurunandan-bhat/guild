New Delhi. Nepal. Rawalpindi. Budapest. Slovakia. Serbia. Vienna. Georgia. Dominican Republic. Athens. Himmat Singh (Kay Kay Menon) has his network spread out all over, there are mutually beneficial trade-offs with Pakistani agents and China, Russia take turns under the spotlight with an Indian-origin psychopath who calls himself a global citizen with no loyalty to any country. Neeraj Panday and Shivam Nair who direct different episodes, update the spy game. Itâ€™s no longer about bombs being set off by terrorists from across the border. The world of technology is more insidious. When Dr Piyush Bhargav (Arif Zakaria), a brilliant tech-savvy scientist, is nabbed in Budapest and agent Vinod Shekhawat (Tata Roy Chowdhury) is killed back home in a shopping mall, Himmat Singh orchestrates action that zig-zags cities and continents.
