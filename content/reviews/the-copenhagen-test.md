The latest spy thriller on the block, The Copenhagen Test, wonders if a person's brain can be hacked. The high-concept drama for Peacock, created by Thomas Brandon, adds extra layers to the story with the spy in question being a child of immigrants. Starring Simu Liu as Alexander Hale, The Copenhagen Test on JioHotstar mixes the spy thriller with sci-fi and adds in covert organisations and political threats. The heart of the series remains with Simu's Alexander, who is not only trying to prove himself as a spy but also asserting his loyalty as an American after the hack.
