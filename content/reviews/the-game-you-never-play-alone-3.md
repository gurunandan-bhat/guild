Cliffhangers are the hot sauce of series storytelling. They're meant to make us drool, lean forward, smack our lips in anticipation. They are old spice, essential for closing out seasons but also necessary as episode-to-episode hooks. They fulfil an ajinomoto-like role in the cooking of compelling shows, and even the most prestigious chefs will cop to their use. The American television critic Emily Nussbaum is dead-on when she writes, "...cliffhangers are fake-outs. They reveal that a story is artificial, then dare you to keep believing."
