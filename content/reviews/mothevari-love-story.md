Life in rural Telangana is often portrayed in Telugu cinema as laidback and unpretentious, with its residents adding quiet character to the setting. Mothevari Love Story, now streaming on ZEE5, draws from this familiar image to tell a gentle tale of romance, sibling friction, and family ties. The series stars Anil Geela, best known for My Village Showon YouTube, in a role that nudges viewers to reflect on familial bonds. Set in Lambadipalli village, the story centres on brothers Sattaiah (Muralidhar Goud) and Narsing Yadav (RS Nandha), nicknamed Ram and Lakshman for their close bond and reputation for settling disputes at the local panchayat. But beneath the harmony, the series hints at tensions: of ego, inheritance, and simmering rivalry.
