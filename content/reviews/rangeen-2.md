Adarsh, a journalist and the founder of a struggling newspaper, is shocked to discover his wife Naina’s sex tape with a male escort Sunny. In a vain bid for revenge, Adarsh resorts to Sunny’s help to turn a gigolo himself. While Adarsh surprisingly finds himself at home in an alien territory, at the cost of his professional career, Sunny’s life falls apart gradually. Vineet Kumar Singh, embracing newer challenges at every given opportunity, shines yet again in Rangeen, continuing his dream run in 2025 after impressive performances in Superboys of Malegoan and Jaat. As an average man, unaware of his casual misogyny and learns of his problems with time, the actor charts Adarsh’s evolution in the show with depth and confidence.
