I watched Hridayapoorvam, the latest Malayalam film starring Mohanlal and directed by Sathyan Anthikad. Sathyan is one of those rare filmmakers who know how to turn everyday life into cinema that feels honest, entertaining, and deeply relatable. At a time when the industry is obsessed with big blockbusters, massive sets, and larger-than-life heroics, here comes a film that quietly wins you over with storytelling, humour, and heart. The film is, in a way, a Malayalam version of The 40-Year-Old Virgin. But don’t mistake that for awkward gags or over-the-top comedy. This is The 40-Year-Old Virgin reimagined with our sensibility — sensitive, clean, and packaged with humour that a family audience can comfortably enjoy. Mohanlal plays a middle-aged, unmarried man, Sandeep, who undergoes a heart transplant. His life takes an unexpected turn when he meets the family of his donor — a widow Devika (Sangita Madhavan Nair), and her daughter, Haritha (Malavika Mohanan). Sathyan sets up a delicate, almost taboo situation: a man who has never really known female attention suddenly finds himself at the receiving end of affection from two women — one closer to his age, and the other much younger.
