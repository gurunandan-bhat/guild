Kajol and co are back in Season 2 of ‘The Trial’ as legal eagles working their way through and around the system geared towards saving the powerful and damning the weak. The previous season began with Noyonika Sengupta (Kajol), reeling by the betrayal of a cheating spouse Rajiv (Jisshu Sengupta), having to find her way back into a profession which she thought she had left behind. The cases, handed out by senior advocates Malini Khanna (Sheeba Chaddha) and Vishal Chaubey (Alyy Khan) plunges her into a discovery of the self — away from the roles of wife and mom to two young daughters — even as she learns to navigate office politics, learning the difference between who is a plunger of the knife (Gaurav Pandey), and who has her back.
