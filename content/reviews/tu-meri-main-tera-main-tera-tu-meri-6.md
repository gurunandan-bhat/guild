How to take a film seriously, which is titled Tu Meri Main Tera Main Tera Tu Meri? Weird wordplay aside, Dharma Productions' latest outing at the movies, starring Kartik Aaryan and Ananya Panday, comes at a time when the nation is still reeling under the Dhurandhar-induced nationalistic fervour. In such a case, the new film TMMTMTTM(even the abbreviation is tiresome) should have helped in breaking the norm with its soft romance. After all, it stars Aryan, a man known for his soft boy romance and comic timing. But director Sameer Vidwans' film, by the end of it, reiterates Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham’s tag line, ‘It’s all about loving your parents’. The result is a very middling story that talks more about sacrifice and compromises than love.
