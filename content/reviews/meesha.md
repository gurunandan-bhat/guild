Hidden within the surface of Meesha (moustache) is an intense drama about lost friendships and betrayal. This friendship may be described simply as one between Anandhu (Hakim Shah) and Mithun (Kathir), but there are larger factors at play to keep them separate. From the outside, it looks like caste is what divides them most. Although they both appear to belong to the same financial class, Anandhu hails from privilege. He appears to stay in an agraharam, and when he struggles to find a job, we hear him complain about reservations and the surname that has kept him poor. On the other end is Mithun, a childhood buddy of Anandhuâ€™s. But as they grow up together, they face societal hurdles that keep them apart. Mithun belongs to a community of fishermen, and he lives in a colony that becomes the hot topic of Meesha. A corporate textile factory is said to come up in this colony, promising jobs, homes, and money to each resident. It will likely lead to development in the future, but for now, it requires this group of 2000 to be relocated.
