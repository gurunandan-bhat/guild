A skeleton of a bison (kaalamaadan in Tamil) plays a metaphorical role in director Mari Selvaraj's 'Bison'. The bison - massive, powerful, and resilient - becomes a symbol of everything Kittan (Dhruv Vikram) must embody to survive in a world that refuses him dignity. At a PT teacher's home, the skeleton hangs on a wall as a memory of his father's occupation. In the hands of Kittan (Dhruv Vikram) and his father Velusamy (Pasupathy), it's worshipped as a God, a form of Varaha. In the climax, the closing shot of Kittan holding the skeleton underwater holds immense power. That's what 'Bison: Kaalamaadan' is all about – channelling the rage and strength of an animal that refuses to be tamed.
