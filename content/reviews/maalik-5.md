If you came for redemption, you’re watching the wrong movie. Maalik is not a typical political gangster drama. It’s a heavy, slow-burn tale of ambition that spirals into wrath, a story where the lines between politics, power and personal vendetta dissolve into one long, blood-slicked road. Know more about Maalik movie story and ending, explained here. The Maalik movie trailer promised us high-stakes drama, and it delivers with guns, grenades, betrayals, and a body count that would make George R. R. Martin blush. Set primarily in a particularly politically charged city of Allahabad, Maalik is a film where every handshake has a hidden dagger and every ally a secret price. And leading us down that path is none other than Rajkummar Rao. He is haunting, magnetic, tragic, and brutal as Deepak aka Maalik. From humble beginnings to self-proclaimed overlord, Deepak’s evolution into “Maalik” is Shakespearean in scope and Greek in tragedy. It’s Scarface meets Sarkar but with a nastier streak. Before we dive into the shootouts and twists, let’s unravel the full Maalik movie story and then walk you through that devastating ending of this gangster movie.
