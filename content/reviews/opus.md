If you have to cast someone as a 60-plus rock star who was once known as the “Wizard of Wiggle,” had 38 No. 1 hits in the ‘90s and used to date Cindy Crawford among many others — and now runs a (ahem!) cult — there is really only one name that comes to mind: John Malkovich. Besides being one of Hollywood's most mystifying stars, Malkovich,71, has directed a play in Latvian, designed his own fashion lines, and even starred in a movie called Being John Malkovich that explores entering his mind. He has participated in shooting a film designed to be viewed in the year 2115, a project that highlights his unusual approach to filmmaking. His involvement in Being John Malkovich, he has claimed, was a deliberate choice, as he wanted to be involved in the "weirdest Hollywood movie ever made". He has also famously said that "he believes he is the least eccentric person he knows."
