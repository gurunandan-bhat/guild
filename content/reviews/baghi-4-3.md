Baaghi 4, led by Tiger Shroff as Ronnie, follows his love affair with the idea of passionate and unapologetic love that can only be expressed through violence. The film explores yet another love story where the villain is also in love with the same girl as the hero, but in this case, he is played by Sanjay Dutt, who is twice the age of the actress. But the makers knew it was an issue and still decided to go through with it, and added a dialogue explaining how love is beyond someone's age. But it isn't beyond everything that happens in this film. The film begins with Tiger Shroffâ€™s Ronnie in an accident, almost being crushed by a train, but in the next scene, he is taken to the hospital. After several very dramatic scenes of Shreyas Talpade crying in front of the doctor, it is revealed that Ronnie has been brought back from the dead, but as his brain is dead, he goes into a coma for seven months. When he wakes up, he asks for a girl, Alisha, but no one knows who she is, not even his brother.
