The intent is to normalise gay relationships, a gay marriage in this case, where the focus is on the story and not on raising eyebrows over sexual preferences. To that extent director Anubhuti Kashyap, and writers Sima Agarwal and Yash Keswani pull it off. Once Dr Geetika Sen (Konkona Sen Sharma) and “wife” Dr Meera (Pratibha Ranta) are accepted by the viewer just as casually as the people in their workplace do, it’s the investigation into a sexual misconduct case that should be the focus.
