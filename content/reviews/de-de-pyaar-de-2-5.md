De De Pyaar De, out in 2019, was a startling first for a mainstream Bollywood film, presenting the idea of a much-older man and a young woman as a perfectly viable romantic option. It isn’t as if Hindi cinema hasn’t toyed with the May-December idea before but not to the extent of getting firmly behind the coupling of a distinctly fifty-plus grey-flecked Ashish Mehra (Ajay Devgn) and a spry 26 year old Ayesha (Rakul Preet Singh), who meet cute in London, fall for each other, and start living together.
