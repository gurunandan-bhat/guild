Cacophony establishes the families and friendships of Titli Mishra (Wamiqa Gabbi) and Ranjan (Rajkummar Rao) as a botched elopement lands them all at the police station. “Papa” (Zakir Hussain), petulantly uttered by Titli, won’t allow her to marry the unemployed Ranjan until he gets a sarkari job. Writer-director Karan Sharma gets the decibel right (loud, louder, loudest) with Banaras as the backdrop for his entertainment whirl that winds up on a noble note. Ranjan’s arc that goes from personal pursuits (naukri, chokri, shaadi) to discovering what the gods intended him to do and thereby understanding what life should revolve around, is a potent plot for a joyride with a social message. Add to it Rajkummar Rao who can switch from fun and frolic to sober-serious without losing a beat. It’s the ideal playground for Karan to have the viewer rollicking with amusement before slipping the conscience into the fray. There are plenty of situations too for dance, song and merriment (romance, pre-wedding ceremonies, comic moments, drama, Shiv mandir, masjid and Allah too).
