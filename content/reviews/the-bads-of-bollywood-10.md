When spanking new director Aryan Khan ends the first episode with an enforced raid sequence that signs off with ‘Say no to drugs’, you groan and wonder if he’s made this a childishly personal show.But as Aasmaan Singh (Lakshya), the boy from Delhi, rises, stumbles and bumbles around Mumbai – like desperately signing a 3-film contract with pompous producer Freddy Sodawallah (Manish Chaudhari) that soon has his career in knots – Aryan hooks you until he delivers a knockout punch at the end. It goes far beyond a glamorous parade of stars who keep popping up, a Ranbir Kapoor appearance most unexpected, Salman Khan turning up at a birthday party and Aamir-SS Rajamouli in a ‘serious debate’. Shah Rukh Khan is served as the cherry on top.
