If you came to Salakaar for a straightforward spy story, bless your heart. You must be new here. The Salakaar web series, now streaming on JioHotstar, isn’t content with just tossing you into the morally murky waters of Indo-Pak espionage. Oh no, it hurls you headfirst. Let’s dive deeper into Salakaar JioHotstar web series‘ ending, which is explained here. The Salakaar plot plays out across two timelines (1978 and 2025), mixing historical what-ifs (basically Salakaar‘s true story part) with enough cloak-and-dagger drama to keep you interested. There are nuclear blueprints, Chinese funding, fake families, and a general who quotes Faiz but bans poetry in public. There’s also the little matter of a bomb that could alter South Asia’s future.
