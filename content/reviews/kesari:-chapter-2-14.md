Barring the title and the fact that both films are about patriotism, Kesari 2 has no connection with its predecessor. Directed by Karan Singh Tyagi, this film, titled The Untold Story of Jallianwala Bagh, is indeed a patriotic narrative; however, its central storyline, which revolves around a courtroom drama, is fictional.
