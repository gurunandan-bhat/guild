Bollywood is going through a ‘sorry’ phase. Last week, in Jaat, Sunny Deol sought an apology from a Sri Lankan extremist. This week, it is the turn of Akshay Kumar to demand an apology from the British government for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. While the former was an outright piece of fiction, director and co-writer Karan Singh Tyagi takes excessive creative liberty with history to manufacture nationalist sentiment and a hero. It seems that after playing with ancient history, the big boys of Bollywood are meddling with modern history. While the dastardly act of the Empire needs to be exposed, the film, produced by Dharma Productions, milks the sacrifice of martyrs in Jallianwala Bagh to create a trumped-up narrative around the tragic episode.
