It’s always heartwarming to see your yesteryear stars, who once made you fall in love with cinema, still continue to give you movies that not only achieve commercial success but are also backed by powerful content. 2025 has been phenomenal for Malayalam superstar Mohanlal, who gifted ‘L2: Empuraan’ - a film that took on right-wing politics - and followed it up with ‘Thudarum’, a delicious thriller based on a father-son duo. ‘Hridayapoorvam’ is his third release of the year and a potential hat-trick. But has it struck gold? Let’s find out! Sandeep Balakrishnan (Mohanlal) is a heart transplant survivor living in Kerala, where he runs a cloud kitchen. Months after his recovery, Haritha (Malavika Mohanan), daughter of his heart donor (Colonel Ravi), arrives in Kerala to invite him for her engagement in Pune. Chaos strikes, the engagement gets called off and Sandeep along with his attender Jerry (Sangeeth Prathap) are forced to stay at Haritha’s home.
