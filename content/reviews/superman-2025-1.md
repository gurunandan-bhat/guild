Clark Kent (David Corenswet) has been leading the dual life of a journalist and Superman for the past three years. To save the world, he is forced to confront Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), a tech genius and xenophobe, whose sole intention is to destroy Superman because the world must bow down to intellect over physical prowess. Over the years, the superhero universe has become increasingly grim, and you can almost sense James Gunn’s annoyance with this trajectory. He gets Superman’s classic red trunks back for a reason - a reset. His hero radiates optimism, which explains why the caped saviour never gives up, even though he spends most of the movie getting beaten to a pulp. Gunn’s Superman is younger—aware of his power but still discovering his purpose. He turns a new page by stripping the character of its modern trappings and reuniting it with its roots -- the comics. Though an alien from Krypton, Superman is a righteous superhero, an ultimate saviour, who must bear the weight of humanity’s survival.
