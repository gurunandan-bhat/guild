They might as well have called Maharaj “Junaid Khan’s Launch Vehicle” because naming it after the villain makes even less sense. We discuss the film’s many irredeemable flaws, which include shaming the victim of sexual abuse, projecting a red flag male character as the protagonist, and resorting to the problematic trope of “fridging.” We also talk about the film’s obvious technical inadequacies, like flat visuals, a haphazard tone, and one-note acting performances. Later in the episode, we discuss why Netflix avoided promoting it, and has essentially dumped it in the hope that nobody notices.
