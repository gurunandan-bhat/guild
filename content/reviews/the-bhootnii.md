The Bhootnii directed and written by Sidhaant Sachdev, explores the horror comedy genre with 2000s vibe focusing on a love story and a forgotten ghost. The plot of the film has a clear path but the execution takes longer than needed to come to a conclusion. The second half does well with its comic timing and few emotional moments but the horror elements are not good enough to compete with the genre pioneers in Bollywood like Stree franchise. The film begins with the story of a mysterious tree that’s been worshiped by college students for as long as they can remember. Everyone prays to the tree for true love and hopes that the wishes comes true. While everyone believes in the tree, there is more to the story. A group in the college is also protesting against it believing that the tree is haunted and it’s causing death of kids whose true love didn’t come true. Past cases have also been revealed about how by Holi celebration, some former students died by taking their own lives.
