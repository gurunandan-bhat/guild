The Moghuls are bad, they wear black. The Hindus are brave, they’re covered in saffron. The screen is red – with blood. “I wanted it to be green,” sneers Zafar (Vivek Anand Oberoi) who wears kohl in his eyes, eyes the throne in Delhi, dreams of being called Sultan and targets Somnath Mandir where the faith of the kaafir resides. Weaned on unwavering belief in ‘Har Har Mahadev’, Hamirji Gohil (Sooraj Pancholi) is courageous and chivalrous. It wins him the admiration of tigress Rajal (Akanksha Sharma) and her father Raja Vegdaji Bhil (Suniel Shetty), a devout Shiv bhakt. Together, Hamirji and the Bhils will guard Somnath against the wicked Zafar Khan. The battlelines between noble believer and cruel plunderer are so clearly drawn that Kanu Chauhan’s story and screenplay begins and ends there.
