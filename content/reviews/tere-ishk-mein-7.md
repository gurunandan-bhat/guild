A director, even an acclaimed one, can certainly be forgiven for refusing to move out of the mould of one of his biggest blockbusters. Expecting yet another ‘Raanjhanaa’ from Aanand L Rai would not be a grave folly, on his part and ours. But when the film, this week’s major theatrical outing ‘Tere Ishk Mein’, reminds you of more than one Bollywood film, you know it’s a misstep. Sure enough, since it stars one of India’s most talented actors, Dhanush, also the Kundan of ‘Raanjhanaa’, you know love will blaze intensely.
