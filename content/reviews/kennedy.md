Kennedy is a former cop who is now a hitman for hire. Set in the dark recesses of Mumbai, aka Anurag Kashyap’s playground, with the director returning to crime noir with gleeful indulgence, Kennedy is distinguished by pulsating action, a deeply brooding core and the Kashyap trademark of anti-institutional protest. Very little in Kennedy is subtle, and the humour, though rare, is often on point, marking Kashyap’s return to form in a genre he has well and truly earned his stripes in. But Kennedy (streaming on ZEE5) is not for everyone. For starters, despite the surprises that pop up often — including a twist on the “I see dead people” trope — it is a bit of an overindulgent slog. The film often feels stretched and Kennedy’s attempt at an emotional pull that seeks to make you empathise with its tragic anti-hero doesn’t quite land.
