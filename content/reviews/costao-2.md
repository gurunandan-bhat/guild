What a wonderful story to document on celluloid. Costao Fernandes, the upright customs officer out to clean the coastal waters of Goa by going after gold smugglers with missionary zeal, has a heroism to his story that is rare. It’s a 90s’ tale unknown to most Indians and needed to be told with impactful storytelling. However, neither director Sejal Shah not writers Bhavesh Mandalia and Meghna Srivastava manage to give heft to his fight against gold smuggling and against the system that impedes his mission. There are flashes that are promising. In what’s supposed to be Costao’s young daughter’s voiceover, you’re told that 24-carat gold is priceless but useless, it can’t even shape into jewellery without milavat. “Mummy says the same about Costao.”
