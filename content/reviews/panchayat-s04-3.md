On our school’s Sports Day, the inter-house cycle race — especially after the success of Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar — would be the most anticipated event. Excited students would line up the oblong track an hour in advance. It was a weekend finale of sorts; everyone wondered who the new ‘Sanju’ would be. It was all about the need for speed. But my favourite event was a relatively unheralded one: the slow-cycling race. I enjoyed the skill and balance required to reach the finish line last without stopping. The best of them would find ways to crawl, manage motion, and make the most of the track — a minute-long nutshell of life itself.
