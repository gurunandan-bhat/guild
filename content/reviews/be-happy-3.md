Schoolgirl Dhara (Inayat Verma) dreams of taking a bow under the spotlight, convinced that she’s born to dance. She is also chirpily precocious as dad Shiv Rastogi (Abhishek Bachchan) dons an apron, makes her breakfast, plaits her hair and mom’s only a wistful memory in a photograph. Choreographer-turned-director Remo D’Souza is on familiar terrain when he sets up a superstar dance competition. A dream platform for Dhara. Renowned dancer Maggie Madam (Nora Fatehi) spurs Dhara’s dream by trying to convince Shiv that Mumbai’s where they should be for Dhara to train for the competition. Set in Ooty, bankers Shiv and father-in-law Nadar (Nassar), a doting thatha (grandpa) to Dhara, banter with a few words of Tamizh thrown in.
