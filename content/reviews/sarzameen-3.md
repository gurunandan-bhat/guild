Dharma Productions' new political thriller Sarzameen, directed by Kayoze Irani, is largely a family drama. But the emotional dynamics between the parents and child, played by Prithviraj Sukumaran, Kajol, and Ibrahim Ali Khan, are thinly connected. Their internal tension is dragged over two hours and 17 minutes in a narrative set in the Kashmir Valley. The thriller is weak, and the story of Sarzameen fails to reel you in. Colonel Vijay Menon (Prithviraj Sukumaran) is a proud Army officer who goes above and beyond his duty. He is posted in Kashmir along with his wife, Meher (Kajol), and son, Harman (Ronav Parihar). The young boy, who often stammers, craves his father's approval. But Vijay has his outdated thinking of what it requires to be a man. Meher tries to mend their relationship, but it cracks further after Harman is used as leverage by terrorists. This further damages the father-son relationship and becomes a question of choice for Vijay: who will he pick, family or country?
