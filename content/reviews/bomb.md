‘Bomb’ begins with a bedtime story about a fictional village, Kallakammaipatti, which splits into Kallapatti and Kammaipatti due to superstition, faith, and perceived superiority. This separation sparks a rivalry that is the film's primary conflict: the ongoing division between the two communities shaped by these beliefs. The story sets the tone for a quirky social commentary, but raises the question: Does director Vishal Venkat execute this central conflict effectively? Let’s find out! Mani Muthu (Arjun Das) and Kathiravan (Kaali Venkat) belong to different communities. Kathiravan, an atheist, looks beyond local politics and dreams of bringing water, electricity, and education to the village. Fighting a lonely battle, he often takes refuge in alcohol. His sister (Shivathmika Rajasekhar) cares for him and secretly harbours feelings for Mani Muthu.
