Born to a humble farmer, Krishnama Naidu is a rebellious son with firm views on society and justice, nursing political ambitions. Rami Reddy, an MBBS student, is trying to outgrow the shadow of his father, a notorious goon. A national emergency is declared by the authoritarian PM Iravati Basu, and as Andhra Pradesh descends into chaos, a change in order seems imminent. Aadhi Pinisetty delivers a fabulous performance as KKN, showcasing his evolution as a tactful leader and as a man of many dimensions. He brings authority to Naiduâ€™s persona while making the character relatable to the viewer. Playing Rami Reddy, an unlikely entrant in politics, Chaitanya Rao Madadi lends enthusiasm and agility to the portrayal.
