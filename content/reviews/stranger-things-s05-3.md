Exposition. Explanation. Emotion. Stranger Things Season 5 Vol 2 rests on these three Es. The other 'E' that worms its way into the three episodes of this volume — before the grand finale drops less than a week later — is 'Exotic Matter' and with it the realisation (courtesy Dustin Henderson) that everything we have thought of the Upside Down over the last decade is not really it. In reality, the evil parallel dimension that has been at the heart of Stranger Things is, well, not a parallel dimension at all. It is, in fact, a wormhole to an even worse dimension that Vecna is trying to "collapse", with an eye on taking over the world.
