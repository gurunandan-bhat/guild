Whether or not a film is crying for a sequel is decided by its box office success or an actor's desire to return in a role promising sure shot glory. Audiences rarely have a say in these matters. When Raid, Rajkumar Gupta's moderately budgeted tribute to the income tax department's unsung heroes came out in 2018, it offered a welcome change of pace from Ajay Devgn's brooding, bashing heroes. Watching him peacefully pursue the path of justice in a tax-defaulting MP's home along with a battery of officers, while the mood continually shifted between humour and hostility, rendered Raid an unshowy strength. A muted Devgn is back on the fore as the 1980s' IT star Amay Patnaik in Raid 2 with bigger targets in mind. Though he is as nonviolent as ever, there's little originality by way of script, which is a classic case of more of the same.
