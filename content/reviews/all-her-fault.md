After the British series The Stolen Girl, All Her Fault is the second series of the year revolving around a missing child attached to a fake playdate. Sarah Snook plays the mother whose child goes missing, and the Succession star ably headlines this strong drama about hidden secrets and family tragedies. Like The Stolen Girl, All Her Fault is also adapted from a novel, and creator-writer Megan Gallagher does well to hold audience interest episode to episode as the truth behind the kidnapper and their motives is revealed.
