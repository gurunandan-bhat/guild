Since his acclaimed debut film, Fruitvale Station (2013), and the subsequent Black Panther installments, Ryan Coogler has adeptly transitioned from independent cinema to high-budget productions, establishing himself as a director of significant interest. In an era where quality standalone films are increasingly scarce in Hollywood, overshadowed by a flood of sequels and superhero narratives, it is refreshing to to encounter a film like Sinners, which reflects a writer/director's desire to convey a story rather than conform to studio demands.
