What happens when two superstars come together? One, Hrithik Roshan as Kabir, a bona fide member of YRF spy universe, who headlined the prequel. The other, super sensation from the South, NTR Jr, makes a new entry but in no less powerful role. Well, the movie becomes a fan-service, a showcase of these two heavyweights. Thus War 2 is as much a battle of their swags as face-offs between their muscle power and show of strengths. For the world, rogue spy Kabir is still a mercenary but as audiences we soon learn he is a patriot who believes in the dictum; death before dishonor, service before self and of course India first. NTR Jr as Major Vikram too is a desbhakt. Or is he? If you have watched War, you know nothing is what appears in this spy-game. ‘Hero ko villain banana aur villain ko hero… tumhara shauk hai kya’… Well, it certainly seems to be the motto of the writer. The story credit belongs to Aditya Chopra.
