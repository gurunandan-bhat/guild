We all loved Arshad Warsi as Jolly LLB. We were equally entertained by Akshay Kumar-starrer part two, but sorely missed the absence of OG Jolly Arshad. So when part three brings them both together, clearly, expectations are raised exponentially. The writer-director of all three instalments, Subhash Kapoor, once again manages to blend comic with gravitas, wit with righteousness. Third time may lose some of its inherent charm, but is not a lost cause either. Indeed, like its prequels, ‘Jolly LLB 3’ has a huge conscience. The preface establishes the burning concern of farmers’ land acquisition and steeps the narrative in emotional gravity and dignity. Despite a serious start, it leapfrogs to the antics of the two endearing Jollys. Akshay is Advocate Jagdishwar ‘Jolly’ Mishra. Arshad is Advocate Jagdish ‘Jolly’ Tyagi.
