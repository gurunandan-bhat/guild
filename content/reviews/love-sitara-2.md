Love, Sitara begins with a nod to Anna Karenina: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,” says Sitara (Sobhita Dhulipala). Unlike Leo Tolstoy’s great novel — whose opening line these words are — the writing in Vandana Kataria’s film isn’t as quotable, though it tries hard. You can assemble a slim volume of pithy self-help slogans from Abbas and Hussain Dalal’s dialogue: “Happiness lies in honesty.” “Dysfunction means they are making an effort.” “I’ll fix myself, before I can fix my relationships.”

Sitara, or Tara, and Arjun (Rajeev Siddhartha), have been dating turbulently for some years. They are both urbane, attractive, career-minded: she’s an interior designer of some acclaim; he’s a chef who’s landed a spot in Singapore. When Tara is informed by her doctor that she’s pregnant —a surprise diagnosis — she withholds this fact from Arjun while proffering her hand in marriage. Both families convene in Kerala, at the house of Tara’s maternal grandmother, where a muhurat is fixed over fresh banana fritters and 2 States-style comedy.
