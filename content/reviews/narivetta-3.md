The Central Board of Film Certification’s screening process can often be arbitrary. Only recently, Indian audiences complained about the CBFC’s decision to have a 30-second kiss shortened in the film Superman. A person on social media pithily observed that the scene would’ve made the cut had Superman been slapping Lois Lane instead of making out with her. There is an element of truth to this, of course. It wasn’t too long ago that the CBFC deemed Marco — a movie in which many children die cruel deaths — fit for public viewing. At the same time, they’ve stalled the release of films such as Honey Trehan’s Panjab 95 and Sandhya Suri’s Santosh. Sometimes, however, this chaotic approach to film certification allows certain movies to slip through the cracks. Narivetta is one of them. Directed by Anuraj Manohar and starring Tovino Thomas, the mere existence of the Malayalam-language film is enough to suggest that the movie gods have a sense of humour. The CBFC can block Santosh, but while they were abusing their power, Narivetta snuck under its nose. A more populist cousin to Santosh, the film fixates on many of the same themes. Narivetta is about the systemic oppression of minorities, and mass corruption in organisations meant to serve and protect; but more than anything else, Narivetta dares to raise objections about police brutality at a time when Rohit Shetty’s cinema has basically coated the concept in Teflon.
