Logout is one more addition in the recent spate of shows and films unpacking the dangers of online excess: it certainly looks like that subject is here to stay, because the addiction-adrenaline-endorphin-glut doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. Pratyush Dua, aka Pratman (Babil Khan) is an ‘influencer’ with a follower count inching close to the magic figure of ten million. His closest rival is a pretty girl whose chief constituency is ‘single desperate ladke’, whose one ‘emo reel’ threatens to beat Pratman, not just in terms of numbers, which is bad enough, but juicy deals, which is worse.
