Director Shanmugam Muthusamy's 'Diesel', starring Harish Kalyan, Vinay Rai, and Athulya Ravi, attempts to tell the story of fisherfolk caught in the world of crude oil smuggling. Despite its ambitious canvas, the film lacks originality and crumbles under derivative storytelling and technical incompetence. 'Diesel' opens with promise. Director Vetri Maaran's commanding voice-over—reminiscent of his 'Vada Chennai'—sets up a compelling premise about fishermen protesting a 17-kilometre crude oil pipeline installation on the shore, protests that end in tragedy and bloodshed. It's the kind of socially conscious setup that suggests substance. But that's where the promise ends.
