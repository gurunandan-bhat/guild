Comedy has become the genre synonymous with Punjabi cinema, and director Smeep Kang’s latest Punjabi-language feature starring Gippy Grewal, Binnu Dhillon and Karamjit Anmol is a fun, family film that comes with a social message. Kang has already delivered a blockbuster hit earlier this year with another Gippy Grewal-starrer, Carry On Jatta 3 (2023), followed by the recent Ammy Virk-starrer Gaddi Jaandi Ae Chalaangaan Maardi (2023). His latest offering, Maujaan Hi Maujaan, fully makes use of the rib-tickling performances of the actors to keep audiences amused. Orphaned at an early age, three differently-abled brothers, Karan (Gippy Grewal), Soni (Binnu Dhillon), and Jassi (Karamjit Anmol) have brought up their sister Aman (Hashneen Chauhan) with a lot of love and wish to get her married. She is in love with Jimmy (Jimmy Sharma) but Jimmy’s father, Shamsher Singh Brar, (Yograj Singh) is prejudiced against differently-abled people and will never allow his son to marry into the family.
