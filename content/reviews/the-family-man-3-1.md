Blending humour with heart, marrying honesty with ingenuity and melding the geopolitical with the personal has been the trademark of The Family Man. It is a formula that has worked for the eyeball-grabbing, almost-cult series across two seasons. Except that none of it has ever felt like formula. That is primarily — if not solely, in many instances — been because of its Everyman protagonist. Manoj Bajpayee’s Srikant Tiwari aka “The Family Man” has never been a conventional secret agent. His looks are deceptive and his ticking time-bomb of a mind is masked by an otherwise imperceptible demeanour, but every time The Family Man has come perilously close to falling prey to convention, its unconventional hero has pulled it back. That also forms the bedrock of its latest season, one that has been feverishly anticipated ever since the curtains came down on its sophomore outing four years ago.
