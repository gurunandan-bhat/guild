In a highly polarised and radicalised social climate in 2025, I am often asked some truly bizarre questions. “You have Muslim friends? Are you left-wing?” Before I can even raise an eyebrow, I am usually met with unverified statistics: “I’m not against Muslims, bro. Eighty per cent of them are good; it’s the twenty per cent I have a problem with.” Sometimes I wonder how, at least in urban setups, we have normalised such conversations. When I watched Anusha Rizvi’s Jio Hotstar film The Great Shamsuddin Family, I was reminded of many eccentric families I know. And I wouldn’t even insert religion here, because this is simply a regular, loud, annoying, over-the-top, yet loving Indian family.
