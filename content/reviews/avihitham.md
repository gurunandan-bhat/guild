If anyone else had written Avihitham apart from Senna Hegde and Ambareesh Kalathera, the second scene of the film would perhaps have become the first scene. It’s the scene in which the plot revolves around a village drunkard who catches a couple making out in the darkness in one corner of a coconut grove. Like the setup of a film like Knives Out (2019), the film plays out like a twisted investigation as the entire village comes together to find out the whereabouts of this couple, all for the vicarious pleasures of seeing someone else’s family fall apart.
