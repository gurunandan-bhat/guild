He is from the north, she is from the south, and amid cultural differences and language barriers, they fall in love. The tale of 2 states has been one of Indian cinema’s favourite themes. In recent years, there have been 2 States which were incidentally based on writer Chetan Bhagat’s life, and two years back, Rockky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahaani-where a Punjabi hero wooed a Bengali girl with all his loud Punjabiyat. Maddock Film’s latest Param Sundari, helmed by director Tushar Joshi, falls in a similar bracket but gets stuck in an attempt to be woke. The film, starring Sidharth Malhotra as Param and Janhvi Kapoor as Sundari, attempts too many things in one go and thereby makes an utter chaos of the film. It is neither too funny, nor too unique – with dollops of predictability thrown in. So, whatever you had expected the film to be (read a middling affair) after watching the trailer, it matches all of them and then some more.
