Parasakthi – the 1952 film title holds significance for multiple reasons in Tamil cinema. The original was crucial for catapulting Sivaji Ganesan's stardom and popularising DMK's (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) ideology in Tamil Nadu, championing Dravidian politics. Decades later, Sivakarthikeyan's Parasakthi, which tackles Hindi imposition, hits theatres ahead of Pongal. Does it ignite fire among viewers? Let us find out!
