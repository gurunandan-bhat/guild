Siddhant Chaturvedi and Tripti Dimri led film explores the story of India's cast system and how it is impacting the youth of today. A decade ago, a film like this would have been about the love story and how the leading characters fought the casteism to be with each other, here it is about how they fought the world just to survive and exist. That big difference makes this film a good watch. Dhadak 2 beings with Siddhanth Chaturvedi's (Nilesh) first interaction with Tripti Dimri (Vidhi). While she is a guest at a wedding, Nilesh is playing a Dhol for the wedding festivities. She goes on to invite him to play at her sister's upcoming wedding and gets herself a 20% discount, unknown to the fact that they two will cross paths again somewhere else. They happen to join the same law college but the reasoning behind their decision is what sets them apart.
