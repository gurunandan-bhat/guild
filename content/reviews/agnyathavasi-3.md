Govindu, a police officer by profession and a farmer by passion, leads a quiet life with his family in Nalkeri, a supposedly crime-free village nestled in Malenadu. His idyllic routine is disrupted when Srinivasaiah, a respected elder, dies under mysterious circumstances. Sensing something amiss, Govindu begins an investigation that draws in Rohit, a tech enthusiast, and Pankaja, the former lover of Srinivasaiah’s son, Arun. Rangayana Raghu gets a rare role that fully taps into his experience and range, with a solid, layered performance. His brooding screen presence is a delight to watch. Similarly, Sharath Lohitashwa, often cast in one-note roles, is refreshing in a sedate, well-intentioned part – a smart casting choice.
