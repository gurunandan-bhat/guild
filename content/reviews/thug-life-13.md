You know Mani Ratnam’s Thug Life movie is about to go off the rails (in the best way) when it opens with Kamal Haasan solemnly standing in a field, musing about death and how he has been shadowed by Yamraj (the Hindu god of death and justice) for ages. From there, we are hurled through revenge arcs and philosophical showdowns. And that’s just the first hour. Let’s explore the Thug Life movie story and ending of the Kamal Haasan movie, which is explained here. The film, after that prologue, begins with a monochrome Old Delhi in the 1990s. We learn that Kamal Haasan (perhaps digitally de-aged, perhaps not) plays the role of Sakthivel, a crime lord who rules a section of Old Delhi with his brother. Their chief rival is Sadanand (Mahesh Manjrekar). The scene begins with a parley between Sadanand and the brothers at the latter’s place. But the parley is a ruse, for as soon as Sadanand leaves, armed police (presumably on his payroll) enter the premises and there is a shootout.
