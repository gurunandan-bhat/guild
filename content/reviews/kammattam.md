In Shan Thulasidharan’s frantically paced Kammattam (Coinage), not a minute is wasted to push us into the world of crime. A man named Samuel (Jeo Baby) has been struck down by a moving car, and it’s clear, right from the word go, that this “accident” was very much intentional. A police officer named Antonio (Sudev Nair) is deputed to investigate. Within the first 10 minutes, the crime, the world around and the people involved have all been established with reasonable efficiency. Samuel is said to have had a chequered past, and this makes him susceptible to almost everyone around him, including close family. The red herrings are laid out with similar swiftness, and by the end of the first episode, we’re left with a handful of suspects, each with enough reason to have committed the crime(s).
