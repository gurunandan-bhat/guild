Aamir Khan is back with his trademark, quintessential feel-good movie. Over the years, the actor has carved out a niche in Indian cinema for making entertaining films that convey important social messages. In the past few years, as the actor tried to experiment in typical commercial fare, the set image dwindled. In 2025, he seems to be back in his comfort zone, playing a reluctant hero in Sitaare Zameen Par, where he typically takes a backseat and lets others shine. Of course, the superstar's presence looms large on this one, but Sitaare Zameen Par works because of its messaging and the way it is delivered. Helmed by RS Prasanna, who had directed the delightful and effective Shubh Mangal Savdhan earlier, Sitaare Zameen Par is the classic underdog story. On many occasions, the film feels cliche and predictable, but it is the bunch of new actors, all neurodivergent, that uplifts this regular story.
