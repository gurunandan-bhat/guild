Presented by Apple and A24, Spike Lee's newest, Highest 2 Lowest, is a heart-pounding thriller set in the Big Apple. Like the title, Lee goes from a high-rise penthouse to a downtown apartment as a music mogul tries to figure out who threatened and stole from him. The American filmmaker reimagines legendary Japanese auteur Akira Kurosawa's High and Low (1963) and sets it in his hometown, New York, while tackling the perils of fame and questioning what it means to be a good man. The result is an exhilarating performance from longtime collaborator Denzel Washington in a film that keeps the viewer on their toes. Washington plays David King, a music mogul who is said to have the “best ears in the business.” On the verge of buying back his stake in his label, Stackin' Hits Records, King receives a ransom call for $17.5 million saying his son has been kidnapped. King moves into action, getting the police involved. Later, it is discovered that it's not Trey (Aubrey Joseph) but his friend Kyle who has been taken instead. Suddenly, King doesn't want to pay the ransom. But when he tries to do the right thing, everything goes upside down.
