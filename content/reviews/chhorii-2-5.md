Early in Chhorii 2, Nushrratt Bharuccha's Sakshi, a school teacher, is in the process of explaining the concept of 'cavemen' — their origin and evolution — to her young students. Given that a major part of the film, thereafter, will play out underground, with the action being dominated by an 'aadi manav', loosely translated in English as 'original man'/'first man', it is an intelligent and effective foreshadowing technique employed by director Vishal Furia. But while Chhorii 2 does traverse some intriguing territory in marrying quite a few novel horror tropes with the greater horrors that the human mind is capable of, it eventually descends into a hurried hodgepodge of mumbo-jumbo and banal balderdash.
