I found myself tearing up a few times while watching Sriram Raghavan’s Ikkis. It’s not because of the film alone, which is based on the military service of India’s youngest Paramvir Chakra awardee, Second Lt Arun Khetarpal – who died during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. It had more to do with the Bollywood war film – a genre that has assumed the responsibility to rile up obvious jingoistic sentiments, thinking it’s the only way to make itself a successful enterprise. Raghavan is too much of a ‘thinking’ and a self-assured filmmaker to give into the temptations of the box office. We’ve also seen dozens of these idols exhibit feet of clay in the last decade.
