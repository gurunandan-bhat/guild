The Principal’s dying to be cool. The acronym-loving kind of cool that says YOLO, You Only Live Once. That’s a hat tip from debut-making director Shauna Gautam to mentor Karan Johar in whose debut film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Archana Puran Singh had played the same ditzy role. The rest of the film too, continues to be Johar territory, revisited, recycled. I’m going to cut some slack for the freshers behind and on screen. This is a new start for the director and for new hero Ibrahim Ali Khan (playing ‘Noyyda’ boy Arjun) while it’s a third attempt for Khushi Kapoor (Pia Jaisingh).
