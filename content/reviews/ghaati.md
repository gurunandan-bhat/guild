As the end credits of Ghaati rolled, the words “The Queen – Anushka Shetty” appeared on screen. It felt apt. Anushka carries a regal presence and has proven across her 20-year career that she can embody powerful characters. Directed by Krish Jagarlamudi, this Telugu film is an action-heavy spectacle, with Anushka playing a woman seeking revenge and striving to lift her community out of an endless cycle of exploitation. Yet, the film struggles to fully realise its potential as a gripping action drama, leaning more on familiar tropes and sheer force than on nuance. The story’s broad contours will feel familiar. Those without a voice toil while business heads profit from their labour, ensuring that people cannot take matters into their own hands. When the oppressed are pushed to the brink, rebellion becomes inevitable, and every rebellion, of course, needs a leader.
