The latest British show has become one of the most talked about series in the recent weeks and rightfully so. Created and written by Paul Doolan, the show is led by infamous Timothy Spall and Gwyneth Keyworth. Following different cases each episode, the series explores the stories of a small town in Wales which unexpectedly holds home to one of the most iconic crime thriller actors of all time (in their universe). The series explores his relationship with a cop, while also delving deeper into the minds and world of the people in and around the town. The show begins with an introduction to Wales cop and detective Sergeant Janie Mallowan played by Gwyneth Keyworth. Her quirky personality is isnâ€™t the thing that separates her from others as everyone in the station is eccentric in their own way. But her eagerness to do her job seems to the thing that sets her apart from others. Though different motivations are at play, her first case on the show puts her in touch with her cinematic hero and a national treasure, an actor who played the detective Cesar.
