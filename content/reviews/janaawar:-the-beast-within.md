Police officer Hemant’s week off is cancelled due to two urgent cases: the disappearance of MLA Jagtap’s brother, Sarju, and a gold theft. A mutilated corpse is found, forcing a desperate search for the missing head. Suspects are arrested, beaten, and confess, but the mystery deepens. The trail shockingly leads to Hemant’s ally, whose confession reveals more layers to the crime.
