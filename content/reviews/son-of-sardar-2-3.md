Everything about a sardar and Punjabiyat is reinforced. The credits open with the title song and each time ‘Son of Sardaar’ is mentioned, there’s a closeup of Ajay Devgn pointing to his kada. Heavy with many mentions that a sardaar never turns his back on anyone under his protective wing, simple farmer Jassi (Ajay Devgn) steps into the UK and into a role he’s eminently unsuited for. The energy that comes with the title prepares you for rambunctious noise. But what director Vijay Kumar Arora and writers Jagdeep Singh Sidhu and Mohit Jain serve is consistent comedy that doesn’t evoke even a smile. At least 80 per cent of Jassi’s adventures in a foreign land where wife Dimple (Neeru Bajwa) has summoned him only to ask for a divorce and for her share of his property, is like an amusement park without joy rides.
