The first adaptation of author Emily Henry's work is off to a flying start. Director Brett Haley stays close to Henry's work with People We Meet on Vacation, as two best friends, Alex (Tom Blyth) and Poppy (Emily Bader), reunite every summer to travel to new places. Of course, with every trip, their relationship changes as they wonder if they could be right for one another. The Netflix film doesn't change the genre by any means, but Blyth and Bader elevate the material with their chemistry and witty banter.
