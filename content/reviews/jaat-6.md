Better than Sikandar. Not quite the ultimate compliment of this season but comparisons are inevitable. It’s almost as if someone studied the screenplay of Sikandar and sat down to correct everything that was wrong with it. We know it didn’t happen that way but storyteller and director Gopichand Malineni does score over southern colleague AR Murugadoss in at least four major departments. Topmost is that Gopichand delivers on his promise with punchy action, a department that could’ve somewhat salvaged the feeble Sikandar. When the unnamed Jaat hero (Sunny Deol whose name is revealed towards the end) starts off with a mild, “I was eating an idli, he pushed my plate, it fell to the ground. Sorry nahi bola,” and ends each such complaint with wild flying fists, the dhai kilo ka haath in full spate, there’s ceetee-podu energy. There are at least four such introductory scenes as the hero’s “Sorry bolo” moves up the chain from the lowest goon right up to the fierce Ranatunga (Randeep Hooda).
