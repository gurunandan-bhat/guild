There are good shows and bad shows. Then, there are shows like Search: The Naina Murder Case, which resist classification not because they are too nuanced for binaries but because they are too frustrating to arrive at such conclusions. Although divided into six episodes, the Rohan Sippy-directed outing feels endless, and it is the jarring lack of ambition, that leaks into every clog, turning out to be its biggest flaw. If I still havenâ€™t been clear, let me just say this: The Naina Murder Case makes Konkona Sen Sharma look bad, and any person worth a Letterboxd account would know, this is not good news.
