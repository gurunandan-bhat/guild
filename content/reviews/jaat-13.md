Jaat marks the directorial debut of Gopichand Malineni, who has primarily worked in Telugu cinema, blending the characteristics of a North Indian hero with southern elements. In this action film, Sunny Deol portrays an angry old man capable of single-handedly confronting and defeating an army of villains. It has been nearly twenty-five years since he famously uprooted a hand pump to vanquish his foes; this time, he utilizes a ceiling fan, a wooden column, and other unconventional objects as weapons. At one point, he proclaims, “Yeh dhai kilo haath ko awaaz North sun chuka hain ab South sunega“ (The sound of these two-and-a-half-kilo hands has been heard in the North; now the South will hear it) This film is a quintessential action movie that could be classified as a ‘masala film’; however, the masala genre typically does not include scenes of decapitation. In some instances, heads are tossed into someone’s hands, while in others, headless bodies are seen moving about, raising questions about the medical plausibility of such scenarios, where men walk akin to a headless chicken. Many acclaimed action films, such as Pulp Fiction, feature blood and gore but often with stylized action choreography. In contrast, this film relies heavily on sickles and swords to sever body parts, to the extent that the censor board had to pixelate several graphic scenes.
