Thode Door Thode Paas is a comedy drama that explores a modern family’s attempt to unplug and reconnect. Set in the lively Mehta household, the ZEE5 series follows Simran (Mona Singh), who runs a bridal wear boutique out of her garage, her husband Kunal (Kunaal Roy Kapur), an online numerologist, their 19-year-old daughter Avni (Ayesha Kaduskar) and school-going son Vivaan (Sartaaj Kakkar). Kunal has added four extra As to his son's name to fix his fortunes, yet his report card doesn’t have even one A.
