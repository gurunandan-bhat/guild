How many of you have ever been in a relationship that might feel perfect, but the timing doesn’t let you pursue it?

Director Prasanth Vijay’s ‘Ithiri Neram’ is a film that addresses all these and the societal judgement that comes with past lovers meeting for one last time. Will it be the last time?
