In Sony Liv’s Court Kacheri, Param, son of a revered advocate Harish Mathur, works under his father against his wishes. Throughout his life, his father had given him a lot more than he wanted, overwhelming him mostly. Meanwhile, for Suraj, a junior to Harish for a long time, a big break in his legal career remains elusive. A seemingly straightforward divorce case lands in their hands, only for it to take wild turns. Good casting choices get a major chunk of the job done, and Court Kacheri is no different, ambling along seamlessly minus major hiccups. Pavan Raj Malhotra’s endearing portrayal of a hardened father is a huge win, and gets the viewer empathising with his choices. Ashish Verma, as the awkward youngster figuring his way out, is impressive in portraying Param’s gradual evolution. Puneet Batra is the surprise find in the show; he mirrors the disappointment and the integrity in Suraj with absolute sincerity. Priyasha Bhardwaj shines as a female advocate standing tall in a male bastion. Others, including Anandeshwar Dwivedi, Kiran Khoje, Sumali Khaniwale, and Bhushan Vikas, make their presence felt.
