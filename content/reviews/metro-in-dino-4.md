When Anurag Basu made Life In A...Metro in 2007, Bollywood anthologies were still a novelty for moviegoers. Add to that, its musical roots by Pritam's sutradhar in rock band mode lend the storytelling a refreshing momentum. By the time he created Ludo in late 2020, his maverick multi-narrative crime drama was another stylish addition in the genre that hit the overkill mark during the pandemic. Circa 2025, audiences have grown increasingly picky with a poor attention span flitting more towards streaming than screen. Metro...In Dino, Basu's soul sequel to its mid-2000s predecessor, is a reflection of this fuzzy mind chronicling a dozen or so protagonists caught in a clutter of chaos and conflict. Slice-of-life, coming-of-age, rom-com, couples therapy, love triangle, teenage woes, mid-life crisis, Metro...In Dino's mish-mash of themes across Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Pune is a hurricane in need of calmer hands. Instead, Basu's trademark whimsy revels in sending his characters round and round in circles until they've spun long enough and collapsed in a tizzy.
