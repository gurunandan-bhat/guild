It’s a cosy situation for surgeon Dr Raj Nagpal (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub) with separated wife Anju (Surveen Chawla) in the apartment across the floor and girlfriend-cum-nurse Roshni Saluja (Asha Negi) in his house to take care of fragile daughter Ira who suffers from Aspergers Syndrome. His mom Gurmeet (Sohaila Kapur) is around too, happy to go along with Raj’s unconventional arrangement. After an eventful 13th birthday party for Ira, the idyllic world is shattered when the housemaid walks in to find Raj holding the bloodied dead body of Roshni in his arms. One scream from the maid and Anju from across the floor comes rushing in. Whodunnit and why?
