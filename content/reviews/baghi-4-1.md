Think of the worst film you have ever watched. Now multiply that by the biggest number you can think of. Baaghi 4 is that film, and somehow even that math falls short of describing what a mangled (pun fully intended) mess this movie is. However bloody you thought this film was going to be, to whatever extent you assumed this film would be a brain-dead watch â€” Baaghi 4 surpasses all expectations. Of course, not in a good way. Blood banks in Mumbai and creativity in Bollywood have run dry, both courtesy Baaghi 4. Granted that the DNA of the Baaghi films is mind-numbing action with very little space for nuance or story. But the fourth instalment is an all-round torture fest with nothing to redeem it. Red paint flows with abandon as humans are killed like cockroaches on screen, but it is you the viewer who bleeds in your seat (my eyes! my eyes!) in a nearly empty theatre.
