Kashmir valley and insurgency in the state have both served as themes for numerous films in Indian cinema. The beauty of the valley and the unfortunate political climate of the state have always been a topic of discussion and heated debate across India, thus serving as the perfect premise for films. Netflix’s latest film Baramulla, featuring Manav Kaul and Bhasha Sumbli in the lead, sets the story deep into the valley, but instead of romanticising about Kashmir, it depicts the grim reality of the place, riddled with curfews, terrorism and more. Directed byAditya Suhas Jambhale, who also serves as a co-writer with Aditya Dhar and Monal Thaakar, Baramulla keeps terrorism as just one of the subplots, while the main plot revolves around a case of missing children, which DSP Ridwaan Sayyed is appointed to solve.
