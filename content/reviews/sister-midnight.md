Sister Midnight, which premiered at Cannes in 2024, and is out in limited release this week in India, is a bizarro-serio-comedy like no other. Radhika Apte plays Uma, a newly-wed on a train heading into Mumbai. The vastness of the city is reduced to a ramshackle kholi that is as alien to her as the man she is married to: Gopal (Ashok Pathak). He is as uncomfortable as she is, when it comes to holding out any kind of comfort or consummation. UK-based British-Indian director Karan Kandhari uses his varied music video experience to layer his debut feature with sounds drawn from around the world. It takes a bit getting used to, and feels all over the place at first, but then you realise how the discordance matches the movie, which is all about jangled people trying to find their rhythm.
