Vash: Level 2 literally hits the ground running â€” pun fully intended. The sequel to the 2023 Gujarati film Vash (which found its Hindi remake in last year's Shaitaan, starring Janki Bodiwala from the original, along with Ajay Devgn, R. Madhavan and Jyothika) retains the deeply unsettling psychological horror vibe of the first film, all the while expanding its canvas in terms of plot and players.
