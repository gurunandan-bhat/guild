When Gangs Of Wasseypur realised and became a cult in subsequent years, it paved the way for similar films. Stories set in the heartland, about crime, and of peculiar names. It set a template that several filmmakers tried to use; some created impact, but most failed to get the flavor that director Anurag Kashyap brought to the Wasseypur series. But what happens when Kashyap uses the same template that he had set to now after 13years? His latest Nishaanchi seems to be heavily inspired by the Gangs series with generational angst, revenge, and a bit of romance thrown in. Starring Monica Panwar, Vineet Kumar, Vedika Pinto, Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub, Kumud Mishra and debutant Aaishvary Thackeray- Nishaanchi has authentic performance and brings back Kashyap’s unique depiction of a small town in North India, but is marred by the filmmaker’s overindulgence.
