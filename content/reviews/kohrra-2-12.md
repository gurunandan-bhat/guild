Screenwriter, showrunner, and now co-director of Kohrra S02, Sudip Sharma has mastered the art of writing loud silences on page. Like Garundi (a scene-stealing Barun Sobti) bumping into his brother, Jung (Pardeep Singh Cheema) at his sister-in-law’s baby shower, and offering him a drink. Everyone except Garundi is able to read the room here. In the first season, the low-level cop is shown to be groomed by his sister-in-law, Rajji (Ekta Sodhi). Jung (shown to be impotent earlier) knows this child isn’t his — and even though he’s aware of his wife’s transgressions, he can’t seem to look it in the eye anymore. Jung tells his brother he wants to go to a Gurudwara and offer ‘seva’ (service) to the almighty. Jung is clearly perturbed by Garundi’s presence, but is too consumed by his own shame to address it. Similarly, a few scenes later, a heavily pregnant Rajji is living with Garundi and his wife, Silky (Muskan Arora), battling morning sickness. Garundi helps her stand upright in front of a sink; their sudden proximity only dawns on both once Silky enters the scene and interrupts it.
