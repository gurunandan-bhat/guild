The timing is unintentionally perfect. Emraan Hashmi starrer military biopic Ground Zero releases just days after the horrific Pahalgam terror attack in Kashmir. While the film is set in the early 2000s and talks of a BSF commandant, Narendra Nath Dhar Dubey, the film is set in Kashmir – a state that is being discussed widely at present. The situation from the early 2000s to the present day may vary, but the enemy – terrorism remains the same. But despite its relevance to the nation's current mood, Ground Zero is a typical military biopic that Bollywood has churned out in dozens since time immemorial. Does the film leave a defining impact? Let’s find out.
