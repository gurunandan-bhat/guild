In 2019, Siddharth Anand’s War gave us answers. That, yes, a big, pulpy blockbuster could look slick enough to make your eyes dance. That the camera doesn’t just love Hrithik Roshan — it worships him in salt-and-pepper mode, an object of thirst so undeniable even Tiger Shroff’s stoic glare softens in submission. That Shroff, with his balletic precision and coiled physicality, could turn action into poetry — especially when put chest-to-chest with Roshan, eyes locked, breath mingling. And that somewhere between the beaches, bullets, and blatant homoerotic stares, mainstream Bollywood might have finally figured out how to make spy thrillers pure cinema.
