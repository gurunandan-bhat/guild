It is a poignant dilemma familiar to most families. When a loved one is on life support, and prolonging it is unaffordable, can you bring yourself to sign the Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) form? For retired librarian Arvind Pathak (Anupam Kher), it is unthinkable. It’s easier for his pragmatic son (Kevin Gandhi) and daughter (Sangeeta Jain) who have their own lives to lead.

Director Gajendra Ahire (who had earlier filmed the same story as Anumati in Marathi) successfully spotlights the heartbreaking helplessness of the aged, the understandable pragmatism of the young and the clinical coldness of the medical system.
