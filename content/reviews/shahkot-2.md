The town of Shahkot in Punjab marks one of the many intersections between India and Pakistan, nations with a shared history that have vacillated between hatred and amity, with the former triumphing more than the latter. Written and directed by Rajiv Dhingra, and starring Guru Randhawa, Isha Talwar and Raj Babbar, the Punjabi-language romance drama Shahkot (2024), makes a bold statement as it explores the possibility of friendship and love winning despite all odds. Iqbal (Guru Randhawa) and Sharafat (Gurshabad Singh) meet while trying to sneak out to foreign lands out of their respective countries. When Iqbal is caught in Pakistan, he is mistaken to be from Shahkot, Pakistan, and starts finding a way to get back home and evade the police. In doing so, he starts working in Abbaji’s (Raj Babbar) home, a politician whose clout keeps Iqbal from being detected. His daughter Marvi Cheema (Isha Talwar) takes a liking to Iqbal, but her father is all set to get her married to Nihaal. Iqbal is torn between doing the right thing and looking out for his own interests. However, when Abbaji decides to get Marvi married to Iqbal, things get complicated and Iqbal must decide what to do.
