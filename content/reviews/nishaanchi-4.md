A dozen years after Gangs of Wasseypur, Anurag Kashyap springs a surprise. A gangster film so engaging that despite juggling with different time zones requiring different looks and general chaos with daddies getting killed, there’s clarity in the characters, situations and stories. Along with co-writers Ranjan Chandel and Prasoon Mishra, Anurag threads them with professional efficiency into a neat narrative. Aided with some of the wackiest numbers and freshest, peppiest background scores heard in a long time. Musicians Manan Bhardwaj, Dhruv Ghanekar, Anurag Saikia, Aaishvary Thackeray, Nishikar Chhibber and Piyush Mishra may take a bow. Early morning Kanpur in 2006. A punctual “manager babu” buys his customary channa-poori at 7.30am. A guard outside a bank gets chatty with a customer who’s come in before opening hours. Soon, a botched-up bank robbery.
