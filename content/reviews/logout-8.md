To promote his film Logout, a cautionary tale about smartphone addiction and the perils of online fame, Babil Khan turned to Instagram, posting a ‘cryptic post’ before deleting it—an all-too-common marketing ploy. It’s one of the self-defeating ironies of the genre. Bollywood—and streaming platforms—are in no position to preach. They depend as much on social media as the nervy, shut-in influencers they depict. They bait, patronise and actively profiteer from the same economy. And like everyone else, they collect data. Directed by Amit Golani and written by Biswapati Sarkar, Logout is best approached as a campy thriller than a revelatory tech satire. Pratyush (Babil) is a young content creator living by himself in a big city. He’s amassed substantial clout making silly sketches on YouTube, viral trash where he assumes both the male and female roles, like an actor in the early days of silent film. He’s close to clocking 10 million followers—a major brand deal hinges on this milestone—but he wouldn’t stoop to any level, or so he thinks. His competitors are the real bottom-feeders. Literally: sliding down their boxers and twerking before the camera for hits.
