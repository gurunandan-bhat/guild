In Hindi cinema, foreshadowing has somehow become a go-to formula for a war film. In 120 Bahadur, the latest in Bollywood’s canon of real-to-reel combat cinema, the signs are all there very early on — a promise to return made to a beloved, a son imagining the happy times he will get to spend with his parents again, a father writing a letter to his young son from a zone of strife, with special emphasis on words like ‘saahas’ (courage) and ‘balidaan’ (sacrifice). When our leading man — Farhan Akhtar’s braveheart Shaitan Singh Bhati — is asked to cut short his leave and called back to duty ahead of the festive season, he tells his wife: “Agle saal Diwali aise manayenge ki iss saal ki kasar poori ho jaaye”. It is such a predictable route to take that one knows he will never make it back.
