Payal Kapadia’s enchanting ode to sisterhood and the glaring contrasts of Mumbai has a tranquil charm to it. There’s a certain tenderness and ease to the flow in storytelling that makes you see the city in a new light, even if you have been a Mumbaikar all your life. Watching Kapadia’s three protagonists setting themselves free from societal and psychological shackles to embrace their desires, gives you that warm fuzzy feeling.

AWIAL sets the mood and tone, right from the captivating docu-style opening sequence. It captures the inner thoughts and hardships of Mumbai’s working class. The camera captures local trains, rain-soaked streets, open markets, bhaaji bazaar and tired people returning home at night with the hope of a better tomorrow.
