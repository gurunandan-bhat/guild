The opening line that a ‘cell’ phone has 1 billion prisoners is substantiated by all that follows. The security guard of a high-rise is so ‘imprisoned’ by a cricket match on his cell phone that he barely notices a visitor putting his name down as ‘Virat Kohli’ in the register. Director Amit Golani is off to an energetic start as a lady comes out of the high-rise and a body comes hurtling down from the terrace. All you see is the splatter of blood on her as she screams. The tone is efficiently maintained as Pratyush Dua (Babil Khan) wakes up to do what every gizmo-reliant, tech-freaky youngster does – ignore calls from Mummy, get gadget ‘Aby-e’ to switch on/switch off the lights and turn on mood music while a robot cleans the house and he’s online all the time. Contactless food, friends whose numbers he doesn’t know by heart coz it’s all stored in one gadget, followers who mean everything to him, an entire life that’s inside his mobile phone. He’s even done the unforgivable with his dad when the parent came between Pratyush and his mobile phone.
