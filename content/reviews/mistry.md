I remember binge-watching Monk back in the day. It wasn’t at the top of my American-sitcom-comfort-viewing list (Scrubs and Frasier were), but I was a Peter Sellers fan looking for the next Pink Panther-coded legacy. I was also curious about Tony Shalhoub’s Emmy-winning performance as an OCD-afflicted detective with all sorts of tics and phobias. Shalhoub was an uncanny mix of funny and sad, turning Monk into an oddball portrait of a grieving husband whose trauma became his superpower. Mistry is a scene-by-scene Hindi remake of Monk, starring Ram Kapoor as Armaan Mistry, a neurotic former Mumbai cop who is regularly roped in by the Crime Branch so that he can declare “the case is cracked” before the end of every episode. Mistry’s assistant-cum-nurse is single mother Sharanya (Shikha Talsania), who follows him around with wet wipes and hand sanitizers, protecting the man from himself while aiding his ‘freelance’ career. Of all the Hotstar adaptations so far, Mistry is perhaps the most uninspired one yet. I feel like I’ve written this line in a previous review before, but such is the business of long-form remakes. The lack of originality isn’t a problem — that’s just the nature of the beast, and who am I to question the commerce of conveyor-belt storytelling? Mistry is likely for anyone who hasn’t seen Monk, and unfortunately for those who have, the comparisons are crippling.
