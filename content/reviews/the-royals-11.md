The Rajkumar and the Aam Kumari. He is royalty, she is middle-class. He rides horses on the beach, sculpted bare chest a-gleam. She’s shiny too, but more from the plebeian pursuit of running. Cool tracks, though, and very sculpted too, but of course, chalk and cheese. Aviraaj Singh (Ishaan Khatter) and Sophia Kanmani Shekhar (Bhumi Pednekar) spark, clash, part, meet again. You know the drill; classic rom com territory. Add in big baubles and bigger palaces, , a phalanx of princes and princesses, and the full Rajasthan rajasi retinue, with the the constant flurry of hukum, khammaghani, leheriya headgear, in place.
