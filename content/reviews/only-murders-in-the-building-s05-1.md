Only Murders In The Building season 5 returns to the hallways of the Arconia after touring to LA in the previous season. This time, our podcast hosts stay in the building and in and around New York as far as the iconic Godfather would take them. The new season doubles down on what works best for them and brings back some iconic characters while introducing another set of crazy characters New York has to offer. The show is obviously coming to an end, but it still maintains its niche writing, and that's the biggest win for Only Murders In The Building. The show begins at the end of the previous season when the now beloved doormen Lester is found dead in the pool of his own blood in the building's fountain. Charles, Oliver and Mabel don't take much time to start looking for clues around the building and among their neighbours before the body is cold and under. However, it isn't enough, especially when the police reports claim it was an accident. As every season of the show unfolds, the latest instalment also follows the trio as they track a list of trails left behind by the killer, which may or may not lead them to the end.
