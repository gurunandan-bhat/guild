Ask me the plot of the last four Housefull movies and all I can recall are crowded frames filled with cringey, racist humour glorifying dumb blokes, dim-witted women, scowling fathers, random animals and rampant innuendoes designed to appease the lowest common denominator in the audience. Like or loathe, the shtick is raking in the moolah and now there's a fifth film in the franchise keeping up its tradition of revelling in stupidity and birdbrain imagination. Only Housefull 5 is so rubbish, you'd think none of the actors, 17 or so of them, have any inkling as to where the script is heading and take the extempore challenge too far. Out of ideas for a while now and resorting to gimmicks like two endings -- luring viewers into double viewings and ordeal -- this Tarun Mansukhani directed fool fest, is the most idiotic thing I've watched this year so far.
