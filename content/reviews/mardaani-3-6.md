The promo was misleading, making it seem like a big screen repetition of what was recently seen in Delhi Crime 3. In DC3, it was lady cop Shefali Shah pitted against venomous don Huma Qureshi while busting a human trafficking syndicate. Same to same in the promo of Mardaani 3 as Rani Mukerji roared into action against a menacing Amma (Mallika Prasad) to finish a human trafficking cabal.
