Thunderbolts\* are the New Avengers, we like it or not, but the world is going to shit and as we know it, the Avengers are not coming to save the day. As Valentina de Fontaine said there are bad guys and there are worse guys, so here we are on another action filled journey. The film comes with a few pleasant surprises. But for now, some bad guys decide to stand up and fill in for the missing good guys. Marvel is making big changes for the new phase and the latest film takes an up-close and personal look at the world and the darkness taking over it. But the Thunderbolts\* quite literally bring the light back to New York City and a bit in our hearts.
