Deliciously sinister and delectably unhinged, Fresh is a commentary on the perils of modern dating, with a refreshingly original take on the splatter genre. This 2022 film, available for streaming on JioHotstar, marks the debut of Mimi Cave (who has since gone on to direct this year's middling Nicole Kidman thriller Holland), and manages to winningly (at least for the most part) be a dark comedy, a feminist tale and a horror fest at the same time. Fresh begins in a way that most films on modern-day urban loneliness do. Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is striking, sharp and smart, but doesn't seem to have much luck in the dating department. With almost no family to call her own, it is her closest pal Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) that Noa leans on emotionally. A few days after a particularly bad first date, Noa bumps into a charming stranger (Steve, played by Sebastian Stan) in a supermarket aisle. Numbers are exchanged, a few fun dates follow and before we know it, Noa is hopelessly charmed by the disarming Steve, who claims to be a doctor specialising in 'reconstructive surgery'. More on that later.
