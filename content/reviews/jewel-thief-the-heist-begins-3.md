The camera globetrots. Budapest, Istanbul, Mumbai, London. Everybody’s cool. Rehan Roy (Saif Ali Khan), a fingersmith who’ll steal the necklace off your body or the mobile in your pocket with smart smoothness. A tad James Bondish too, the names of women in bed don’t matter. And he is the ultimate jewel thief, popular in the crime world as unmatched, unbeatable. Rajan Aulakh (Jaideep Ahlawat), the Page 3 rich man. So unflinching cool that the rottweiler he fed with his hands as a puppy gets a bullet in its forehead for cosying up to Rehan. So cool that he’ll watch a piece of art on his wall and admire its splosh of colour. It’s real dried blood of a human he’d strangled for tattling on his offshore accounts. Deficit of trust brings out the underworld gangster in him.
