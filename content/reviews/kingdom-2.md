A film that hinges on brotherhood and a man's/woman’s larger purpose in life has to get one aspect right. And, it's not the scale or the music. It’s the emotion. You need to connect and resonate with the characters on-screen to feel their pain and joy. However mediocre the story might be, if the emotion connects, the film lands! Director Gowtam Tinnanuri’s ‘Kingdom’ promised to be a story of brotherhood, a spy thriller and a lot more. Has it cracked the magic formula? Let’s find out! ‘Kingdom’ begins in the 1920s, with a tribe called Divi fighting against the British. The tribe fails in the fight with the hope that a saviour will arrive to put off their worries. 70 years later, we see Suri (Vijay Deverakonda), a constable searching for his elder brother Siva (Satyadev). Siva fled after killing their abusive father and ran away from home. His attempts to find Siva land him in a covert mission.
