Music director-turned-actor Vijay Antony has a knack for picking interesting stories. However, his choices in the last few years have been questionable. The actor now returns with ‘Maargan’, a crime thriller about a serial killer. Will ‘Maargan’ provide a much-needed respite to Vijay Antony from a string of underwhelming films? Let’s find out! Dhruv (Vijay Antony), ADGP in Mumbai, is grieving the loss of his daughter, who was murdered by a serial killer. He is notified of another similar murder in Chennai. One connection between both cases is that the killer seems to have injected a drug which blackens one’s body. Dhruv expresses interest in transferring to Chennai to investigate the murder. However, his superiors don’t let him as he is recovering from the loss of his daughter. His left side is blackened after he gets injected with the drug while trying to nab the killer.
