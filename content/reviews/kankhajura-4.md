Adapted from Israeli show ‘Magpie’, a chirpy synonym for police informers, Kankhajura brings the tale home, to Goa. Ashu (Roshan Mathew), out from prison after 14 years, goes looking for his beloved older brother Max (Mohit Raina), and finds him very well-off, and looking to expand his construction business, along with his old pals Pedro (Ninad Kamat) and Shardul (Mahesh Shetty). This cosy little triangle has no place for Ashu, and once again, he finds himself on the periphery, desperate to get an in. As he tries wriggling into his brother’s personal and professional spaces — getting close to Max’s svelte wife (Sarah Jane Dias) and daughter, and hovering around Max and his bros — he finds himself constantly rebuffed. His only solace is another old friend Amy (Trinetra Haldar), who used to be Amay, and who now runs a tiny bakery in one of those picturesque Goan villages.
