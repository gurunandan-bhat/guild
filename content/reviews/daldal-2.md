Daldal, adapted from Vish Dhamija’s novel Bhendi Bazaar, is a crime thriller created by Suresh Triveni, written with Sreekanth Agneeaswaran, Rohan D’Souza and Priya Saggi, and directed by Amrit Raj Gupta. The seven-episode series on Prime Video revolves around DCP Rita Ferreira (Bhumi Pednekkar), a Mumbai Police officer investigating a serial killer. Rita is introduced as brooding, humourless and emotionally sealed off. Violent when provoked, shaped by childhood trauma, Rita is also nursing the fallout of a broken engagement.
