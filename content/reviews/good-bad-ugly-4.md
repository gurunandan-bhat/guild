Who knew that a character sending a specific someone’s photo on a WhatsApp group would make for one of the ‘massiest’ sequences we have seen in recent times? Director Adhik Ravichandran, who, over the last ten years, has gotten us used to his use of bright colours, dutch-angle shots and quirky humour, takes it up a notch with his fifth film Good Bad Ugly (GBU), and with his idol Ajith Kumar headlining it, the young filmmaker pulls off what netizens would term as a “fanboy sambavam.” In GBU, AK (Ajith Kumar) is a retired gangster who has spent his due share of time behind bars and wants to lead a happy life with his wife, Ramya (Trisha), and son, Vihaan (Karthikeya Dev). But trouble comes knocking his way when his son is wrongly arrested and put behind bars. For the sake of the very son for whom he put down arms, AK now has to enter a world he vowed never to return to.
