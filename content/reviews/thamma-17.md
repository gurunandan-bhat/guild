The Maddock supernatural universe is growing at a pace that surpasses the Big Bang. The achievements of Stree, Bhediya, and Munjya have led to the introduction of a new character, Thamma. This film, directed by Aditya Sarpotdar, who previously delivered the sleeper hit Munjya last year, presents fairly conventional content and storytelling.
