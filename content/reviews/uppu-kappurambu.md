Prime Video’s latest offering, ‘Uppu Kappurambu’, revolves around an interesting premise, albeit set in a fictional village. A quirky comedy, the Ani IV Sasi-directed film is a clever social commentary on dignity in death and how people are now easily divided over communal differences. Has ‘Uppu Kappurambu’ hit the right notes? Let’s find out! Chitti Jaya Puram, a fictional village, is full of zany characters who follow age-old practices that reek of ignorance, patriarchy and what not. Apoorva (Keerthy Suresh) becomes the village head following the death of her father, who died on duty. But, Apoorva’s father fully prepares her to take on duties and calls it the easiest job ever. One day, the village’s graveyard caretaker, Chinna, approaches Apoorva with a real problem. The graveyard is now short of space, and she is stuck figuring out a solution. Meanwhile, there are influential people in the village, Bheemayya (Babu Mohan) and Madhubabu (Shatru), who want to bring down Apoorva because they do not want to be under a woman’s leadership. How does Apoorva deal with these patriarchs amid a brewing cultural problem that forms the crux of the story?
