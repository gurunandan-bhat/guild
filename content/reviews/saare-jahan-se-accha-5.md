The Hindi series Saare Jahan Se Accha is a fictional take on historical events and is centred around India and Pakistan's nuclear programs. Created by Gaurav Shukla, the show is set during the late 1960s to early 1970s, focusing on the early days of India's Research and Analysis Wing and its attempts to sabotage Pakistan's nuclear program. The taut thriller globetrots all over the world, but the action in Pakistan is where the story matters. The makers build up the suspense and action, leading to a dramatic and satisfying finish. Pratik Gandhi plays Vishnu Shankar, a counterintelligence officer who becomes a RAW agent under RN Kao (Rajat Kapoor). The newlywed heads to Pakistan with his wife, Mohini (Tillotama Shome), for a dangerous mission to find out what is going on with their nuclear program. ISI chief Murtuza Malik (Sunny Hinduja) runs a tight ship, weeding out traitors and spies while helping Pakistan cross the finish line to become a nuclear power. The clash of these two individuals and their successes and failures makes up more of the story of Saare Jahan Se Accha.
