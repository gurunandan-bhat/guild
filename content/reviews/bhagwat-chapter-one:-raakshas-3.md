Two excellent actors, thriller genre, a real story and an authentic setting… ‘Bhagwat Chapter One: Raakshas’ seems to possess very many ingredients that make for a gripping fare. Indeed, the film starts off well: a girl has gone missing. Arshad Warsi, as Inspector Vishwas Bhagwat, has serious anger management issues and gets a punishment posting in the same town. He has a backstory, which is just hinted at to begin with, but explains both his anger and passion to go after criminals like a man possessed. His investigation into this particular case not only leads him to many more missing girls, but also dead end after dead end, until a breakthrough presents itself.
