One could be half an hour into the setup of Sashikanth’s Test and still be unsure of the genre of the film. When seen from the point of view of 34-year-old Kumudha (Nayanthara), Test is arguably about the testing phase leading up to her last attempt at being a mother. As for Indian team cricketer Arjun (Siddharth), who struggles with his form in what could be his final test match, the movie could be a sports drama about regaining respect from oneself. Finally, when you lean closer into Sara (Madhavan), the out-of-luck MIT scientist just one step away from changing the world, you could even look at Test as a sci-fi film about hydro-fuels. Not that this mix of genres in Test isn't necessarily a bad thing. The film spends so much time planting us within the conflicts of each of these characters that you feel like you’re being set up for the ebbs and flows of a juicy mini-series, wherein each character is as important as the last. It’s a film that could have gone anywhere with its complexities; however, instead of going deeper into any of them, Test chooses to settle on one central plot line as it approaches the halfway mark.
