The Crown and Fantastic Four: First Steps actress Vanessa Kirby delivers yet another terrific performance that is the cornerstone of this uneven thriller. Her character is pushed to several lengths as she moves mountains to protect her family. Based on Willy Vlautin's 2021 novel The Night Always Comes, the Netflix film is set in moody Portland, Oregon, where the forecast is already grim. However, despite the strong performances by its excellent cast, director Benjamin Caron and screenwriter Sarah Conradt aren't able to elevate the narrative to be believable. The crime thriller takes place over a ragged 24 hours in which it is established that Lynette (Kirby) is deeply in debt. She needs a down payment of $25,000 to sign a loan with her mother, Doreen (Jennifer Jason Leigh), to save their family home and her older brother, Kenny (Zack Gottsagen), who has Down's syndrome. If the house is in his name, he won't be sent away to a special facility. But of course, nothing goes her way. Her mother buys a new car instead and a desperate Lynette runs around Portland, calling in every favour she knows and meeting unsavory characters to gather the money.
