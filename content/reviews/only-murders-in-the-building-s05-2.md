How many murders can you have in a building? Turns out one every season, and we hope the corpses continue to fall because the fifth season of Hulu's Only Murders in the Building is warm, funny, and oddly delightful. Several new characters are added this season, but it doesn't take away from the core protagonists as they investigate the murder of one of their own. Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez are once again the highlight, while Meryl Streep is the best addition to the stellar show. Season 5 of the series looks at a New York institution, the doormen of the Big Apple who keep the buildings running. Viewers knew from last season that the Arconia's beloved doorman, Lester (Teddy Coluca), was found dead in the courtyard fountain. Charles (Steve Martin), Oliver (Martin Short), and Mabel (Selena Gomez) decide to investigate the mysterious circumstances, which takes them down memory lane into the history of the Arconia itself with interactions with mobsters and billionaires that provide more clues.
