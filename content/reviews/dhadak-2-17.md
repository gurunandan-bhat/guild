Nothing underlines the wild, rebellious heart of Mari Selvaraj’s Pariyerum Perumal (2018) quite like Santosh Narayanan’s music. For example: during a stretch, when the hero (Kathir) and heroine (Anandhi) are spending time apart, after he’s warned by her father since they belong to different castes, the hip-hop song Naan Yaar starts playing to some dynamic visuals. As much as it’s about heartbreak, the sequence is also about the protagonist’s inner tussle with his own beliefs. Shazia Iqbal’s Dhadak 2, a Hindi adaptation of the 2018 Tamil film, uses a more conventional ballad (sung by Vishal Mishra) during this stretch, muting the male protagonist’s reckoning with his identity, replacing it with a more palatable subplot of aching, star-crossed lovers. The choice dilutes the source material’s counter-cultural intent, making it a more yielding piece of work.
