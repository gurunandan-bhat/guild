Kartik, a man from Ujjain, falls obsessively in love with the mysterious Charu. When she suddenly vanishes, his life turns into a relentless search. He soon finds himself entangled in the dangerous world of a ruthless politician, Huntry Chauhan. As Kartik travels from India to Georgia to find the truth, he must navigate a web of deception, violence, and changing loyalties where love comes with a price. For the masala genre to click, besides writing and direction, you want the actors to submit to the world fully without chasing logic. The viewer can catch glimpses of it in Tejasswi Prakash and Anud Singh Dhaka’s performances. One hoped the writers invested the same thought in giving substantial characters for Srishti Shrivastava and Tejasswi as much as they did for Anud and Kishan’s parts.
