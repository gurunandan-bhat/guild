When we first met her in the summer of 2014, Shivani Shivaji Roy made an instant impression. Played by Rani Mukerji in a way that seemingly flumped a woman as a misfit in a man’s world but one that she steadily made her own non-negotiable domain — one punch and punchline at a time — Mardaani, with Rani leading with her feisty and fiery walk and talk, not only gave us a shero to cheer for but also a film that naturally lent itself to a franchise.
