In an early scene in the Telugu film Kingdom, Soori (Vijay Deverakonda) slaps a police officer. What follows reveals the reason for his outburst layered with purpose and tact. Writer-director Gowtam Tinnanuri is not merely positioning his lead as an archetypal angry young man with swagger. While the moment might initially cater to Vijay’s ‘rowdy’ persona, the screenplay slowly peels back the layers, giving Soori’s rage emotional resonance and narrative weight. Emotional depth in storytelling is Gowtam’s calling card, evident in his earlier films Malli Raava and Jersey. It is this very quality that anchors Kingdom, keeping it from slipping into yet another larger-than-life action fantasy built for box office glory. On the surface, Kingdom might invite comparisons to KGF,Devara, or other films— with familiar tropes like gold smuggling, a forgotten island, and an oppressed people in need of a saviour. But beneath the dust and dynamite lies a story that is more emotionally driven, and steeped in moral reckoning.
