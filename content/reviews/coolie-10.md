Superstar Rajinikanth’s latest movie Coolie is trash! At least, that’s what the general consensus among reviewers seems to be. There are reports about falling footfalls, defying earlier expectations of it becoming Tamil cinema’s 1000-crore grosser. But if we set aside these endless discussions about ticket sales — which, let’s face it, none of us have any stake in — our financial fate won’t change, no matter how many crores the movie makes. Why would we give even a two-hoot about a film’s commercial success? That’s a discussion for another day. Coming back to Coolie, I initially refused to read any reviews or listen to anyone’s opinions. Despite my best efforts, I couldn’t avoid stumbling upon multiple negative takes. The headlines all said the same thing: “Coolie is a huge disappointment.” “Lokesh Kanagaraj fails to deliver on expectations.” Memes and posts across social media screamed the same.
