‘Maareesan’ brings together Tamil comedy legend Vadivelu and brilliant performer Fahadh Faasil for the second time after ‘Maamannan’. While the two have their individual strengths, they are terrific performers. Give them any role, their eyes are enough to pull them off. Director Sudheesh Sankar’s ‘Maareesan’ is a comedy thriller, a genre that could either be effective or a total misfire. Dayalan (Fahadh Faasil) is a thief who is just out of the infamous Palayamkottai prison. In his words, certain houses talk to him and call him, so he could rob them. Soon after his return, he finds Velayudham Pillai’s (Vadivelu) house calling him. He breaks into the house to steal, but only to find Velayudham chained to his bed.
