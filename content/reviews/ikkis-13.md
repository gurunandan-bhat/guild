When Arun Khetarpal (Agastya Nanda) receives a copy of Ernest Hemingway’s For Whom The Bell Tolls, filmmaker Sriram Raghavan has already hinted to the audience how he will be tackling the heroics of the Param Vir Chakra-awardee protagonist. He’s essentially telling you to keep the hankies ready. Ikkis isn’t a straightforward biopic of a young, enthusiastic army officer who dreams of fighting and beating the foe. When Khetarpal brings his golf clubs to the training camp and defiantly declares to his senior that he will put them to use in Lahore after victory, he gets a beating down: a war decides whether a fool is a braveheart or a braveheart is a fool. In his second on-screen outing, Nanda plays out Khetarpal’s innocence and righteousness well. Joining the Indian Army, he confidently tells his colleagues that his aspiration is to sacrifice his life.
