Rahul Sadasivan’s newest horror film, Dies Irae, portrays itself as more than just a haunted house exercise. In addition to jump scares and well-executed visual fright-craft, the title Dies Irae (Latin for “Day of Wrath”) alludes to a reckoning, something ominous. Let’s dive into the story of the Dies Irae movie and ending, explained here. Our hero is called Rohan, and he is the rich-brat-mega-mansion-owner type. Played by actor and Mohanlal‘s son Pranav Mohanlal, he has the house, the money, the parties, the friends. He also has a casual indifference toward those he considers inferior to him, which is pretty much everyone.
