Izzat. A loaded word that, in most parts of Indian society, sits heavy on women. Women need to dress a certain way, behave in a manner that is deemed fit by men (and also other women) and mingle sparingly with those of the opposite gender, mostly under the cognisance of the family. Men claim to be the upholders of izzat, but their actions — no matter how unlawful, bigoted or discriminatory — don't seem to tarnish it in any way. This, unfortunately, is the truth of a large demographic of our population, fed as it is with archaic, often illegal notions of caste discrimination and pervasive gender roles. The cock-a-snook attitude that Dhadak 2 throws at these ideas and practices hits hard — "bohot hard". It is a mere coincidence that Siddhant Chaturvedi, who rose as MC Sher in Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boy — yet another story of a marginalised talent fighting (or rapping) his way to the top — plays the leading man in this Shazia Iqbal-directed film.
