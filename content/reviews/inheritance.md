Neil Burger's Inheritance zips across the globe from New York to Seoul in a compelling thriller that features a heroine with a strong survival instinct. Bridgerton star Phoebe Dynevor is Maya, who gets a chance to repair her relationship with her father, Simon (Rhys Ifans). However, she soon realises that leopards don't change their spots. The innovative feature of Inheritance, besides the fact that it's filmed on location in Egypt, India, and South Korea, is that the film has been shot with an iPhone 13 Pro. The guerilla-style filmmaking works to a large extent, but it's the suspense of what Maya will do next that keeps viewers locked in. New Yorker Maya (Dynevor) has just watched her mother die of cancer when her estranged father (Ifans) shows up at the funeral. Despite her sister Jess's (Kersti Bryan) warnings, Maya agrees to accompany Simon on his work trip to Cairo. Soon enough, she remembers why the family kept their distance in the first place. Maya is pulled into a complicated operation spanning countries with several authorities on her case as Simon dubiously disappears. Will Maya be a dutiful daughter and complete the assignment? Or will she uncover more hidden secrets about the mysterious man?
