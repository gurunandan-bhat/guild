On Nayanthara's 40th birthday, Netflix unveiled a documentary series, Nayanthara: Beyond the Fairy Tale, chronicling her journey in the film industry. The series opens with her disappointment over not securing permission to hold her dream wedding at the Tirupati temple and transitions to her eventual wedding at a picturesque beachside glasshouse, attended by the who’s who of Indian cinema.

However, just before the documentary’s release, Nayanthara made headlines by issuing a strongly worded letter addressing Tamil star Dhanush . She accused him of holding a grudge against her and her husband, Vignesh Shivan, and alleged that he denied permission to use footage and songs from the movie Naanum Rowdy Dhaan.
