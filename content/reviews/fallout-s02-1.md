Fallout first premiered alongside The Last of Us in 2024 and established itself as a worthy addition to the world of video game adaptations. Now, as it returns for its second season, the Amazon Prime Video game doesn't waste time in setting up the universe anymore. It dives right into the next phase as the main characters are once again separated, off on personal quests to seek answers. The one exception is Lucy (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), who reluctantly team up. Their dynamic is what drives this exciting new instalment that shifts into second gear, with vast, unexplored locations, new characters, and more.
