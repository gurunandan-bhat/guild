The third installment in the Ardaas film series, Ardaas Sarbat De Bhale Di (2024) brings to light the travails of the human condition and our relative inability to deal with them with fortitude. Directed and written by Gippy Grewal, the Punjabi-language film stars Grewal, Gurpreet Ghuggi, Jasmine Bhasin and Prince Kanwaljit Singh. Devotional films have been the mainstay of Punjabi cinema since its inception, and Gippy Grewal’s Ardaas series renewed interest in the genre in 2016, with the release of the first Ardaas. Directed by Grewal, all three Ardaas films stress on the teachings from the Gurbani (the hymns in the Guru Granth Sahib), while highlighting common social issues.
