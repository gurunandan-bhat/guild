The Summer I Turned Pretty's final chapter takes tentative steps towards adulthood as Belly (Lola Tung) gears up for her senior year of college. Her friends and family around her also go through some major changes. But the real focus of the Amazon Prime Video coming-of-age series will always be about Belly's choice of partner. Will she choose her first love, Conrad (Christopher Briney), or his younger brother Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno)? In this final 11-episode season, creator Jenny Han puts the trio through yet another roller-coaster summer to remember. A time jump shows Belly and Jeremiah happily together at Finch University. But that happiness is short-lived as Jeremiah's graduation is delayed and Belly gets chosen for a study abroad program in Paris. Conrad is thriving across the country at Standford where he's doing well studying to be a doctor. The gang plans to head back to the family home at Cousins Beach for a dedication ceremony for Conrad and Jeremiah's mother Susannah (Rachel Blanchard). But will the reunion be happy or awkward?
