What comprises a good deed? Is it as simple as feeding the cows, or even the poor, or lighting diyas around sacred trees? Of course, before we come to the heart of the film, it begins on a light-hearted note, even beats around the bush, and only then arrives at what it intends to convey. Love birds Ranjan (Rajkummar Rao) and Titli (Wamiqa Gabbi) have eloped. Only before they actually run away, Titli decides to flit back. They return home. No, hell doesn’t break loose. Parents, even in Varanasi, are not that unreasonable. Only the girl’s father puts in a caveat, “Find a government job within two months if you want to marry my daughter”. And you get the crux of the storyline. In the hero ‘buying’ a government job and finding his way to ‘happily ever after’ lies the rest of the drama.
