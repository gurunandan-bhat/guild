The Apple TV+ period romance The Buccaneers returns after a year and a half for its second season, in which the five young American women plant firmer roots in England. But compared to the events of the premiere season, the women are faced with more obstacles as they assert their identities in the middle of a patriarchal society. Amidst that, the series created by Katherine Jakeways develops into a more vibrant and messier version of itself than Season 1, especially when dealing with its romantic storylines. Set in the 1870s during the Gilded Age, the American women have now married into British society. Nan (Kristine Froseth) becomes one of the most powerful women with the title of Duchess of Tintagel, a position she uses well to shield her sister Jinny (Imogen Waterhouse) against her abusive husband. The rest of the young women, American heiress Conchita (Alisha Boe) and sisters Lizzy (Aubri Ibrag) and Mabel (Josie Totah), have newer mountains to overcome. Nan's mother, Patti (Christina Hendricks), decides to leave her husband with her sister, Nell (guest star Leighton Meester), by her side. Nan's mother-in-law, the Dowager Duchess (Amelia Bullmore), also gets a second chance at romance. But not all of these endings are happily-ever-after this season.
