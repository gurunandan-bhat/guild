Horrors of the land, horrors of the mind and horrors of the past coalesce in Baramulla. The result is an intriguing concoction which may often feel unique, but also one that makes for an uneven ride. Set against the potent backdrop of Kashmir — as is evident from its unequivocal title — Baramulla explores the historically ravaged land where the terror of the present and the trauma of the past co-exist on an everyday basis, one often seeping into the other.
