The first season of HBO Max's The Pitt became a breakout hit after it focused its attention on the forgotten frontline workers in a Pittsburgh hospital. Now, a year after its premiere, the medical drama is back with its unique storytelling format and more urgent conditions for its characters. With each episode taking place over an hour, The Pitt highlights the many challenges faced by healthcare workers in America. This time, the show unfolds over the busy national holiday on the Fourth of July and delves more into the doctors' and nurses' lives as well.
