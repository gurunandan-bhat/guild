Jolly LLB 3 has two Jollys, Jagdishwar Mishra (Akshay Kumar) and Jagdish Tyagi (Arshad Warsi), for the price of one, facing off in and out of a Delhi court. Their initial rivalry, spread over the first half, predictably rolls over into the two joining hands against the victims of a huge land fraud perpetrated by greedy land-grabbers, and their partners.
