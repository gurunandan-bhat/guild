The success of Jolly LLB (2013) led to a sequel in 2017, and it took 8 years for the next installment to be made. Jolly LLB 3 has good intentions but ultimately comes across as both preachy and predictable. This might have been acceptable if the film had been concise and focused; however, it stretches the narrative for well over two hours, incorporating various elements that feel disjointed.
