Haq, the new propaganda movie starring Yami Gautam Dhar and Emraan Hashmi, is even more insidious than _Dhurandhar_. We talk about the film’s harmful stereotypes, the irresponsibility of presenting an entire community as savages, and drawing a direct line between bad behaviour and faith. We also discuss the film’s sloppy storytelling, childish approach to complex ideas, and its constant need to spoon-feed its audience.
