Family dramas always make up for great stories. There’s drama, never-ending conflicts, and a whole lot of plots and sub-plots to make for a wholesome script. Yet, this is one such genre that could always fail, if the script is not taken care of. Director Prasanth Pandiyaraj’s ‘Maaman’ is one such film that explores the relationship between Uncle Inba and his hyperactive nephew Laddu. Inba (Soori) is a perfect husband-material according to Rekha. He respects the women in his life – his sister Girija (Swasika) and his mother (Geetha Kailasam) – the most. Inba’s sister Girija has to bear the brunt of society’s sharp words because she has been childless for a decade. When she gets pregnant with Nilan aka Laddu (Prageeth Sivan), Inba is more present than her husband (Baba Baskar). Let’s put it this way – Inba’s overpowering love doesn’t let her husband be the husband and the father he wants to be.
