First things first. For those who go looking for a detailed sketch of Gopal Patha, the so-called ‘Butcher of Bengal’, will be disappointed. The reason for this is evident. For the past several weeks, all we’ve been hearing in the context of Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri’s The Bengal Files is how it thrown a light on a forgotten chapter of our recent history in which Gopal Chandra Mukherjee, a local strongman, saved Calcutta from being ‘annexed by Pakistan’ on Direct Action Day on August 16, 1946. The first part of the statement is accurate. Yes, there are several slices of pre-Partition, pre-Independence events recreated in the three-and-a half-hour film, in which we see Gandhi arrayed on one side and Jinnah on the other, with the latter’s demand of a Muslim Pakistan being put into motion by the reluctantly-departing British.
