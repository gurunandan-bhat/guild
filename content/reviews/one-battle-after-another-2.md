Paul Thomas Anderson’s One Battle After Another serves as a reminder that it is the same director behind There Will Be Blood (2007), although this film ventures further into uncharted territory. It encompasses political themes, satire, action, and family drama. Above all, this film showcases the filmmaker's mastery of his craft – from the musical score to the cinematography, there is an abundance of elements to appreciate in this work.
