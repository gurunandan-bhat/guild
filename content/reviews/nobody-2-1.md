Nobody 2 brings back the old man in an action film gimmick, but the makers stay true to the franchise's tone, keeping it family-friendly and light. The action sequences are amusing and gory, similar to those in the first film, but they are witty enough not to feel repetitive. The novelty of watching a middle-aged man fighting does wear off, but the full-circle moment in the film makes up for it. Until the usual sequels, with just newer villains and bigger baddies, we do a refreshing take on making friends with call backs to the good moments in the original film.
