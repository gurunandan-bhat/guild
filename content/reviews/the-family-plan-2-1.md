The Family Plan, starring Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Monaghan, was a surprise hit of 2023 for Apple TV, so naturally it must be brought back. In the holiday sequel, The Family Plan 2, the Morgan family once again find themselves going on the run. However, changing the setting from the US to Europe lifts the spirit of the feature overall. But director Simon Cellan Jones and writer David Coggeshall have a villain problem on their hands for a second time.
