Set in the late 90’s, the pre-Instagram era, when ‘get ready with me’ reels were non-existent, privacy had a different meaning. Without having the platform to post their private life anywhere, couples voluntarily recording their intimate moments was still a rare phenomenon. So on paper, the film’s script sounds promising. What happens when this private video belonging to a middle-class couple from Rishikesh goes missing? What are the repercussions and can they retrieve it?

The writing and execution take a bizarre turn and oscillate between slapstick comedy, social cause and supernatural, without a valid reason, making this overcrowded film a tiring affair. Barring Rajkummar and Triptii, Shehnaaz Gill has a dance number. Vijay Raaz and Mallika Sherawat have crucial roles. Ashwini Kalsekar has a special appearance, Archana Puran Singh, Rakesh Bedi, Tiku Talsania, Mukesh Tiwari populate the proceedings too.
