A line from the Tom Cruise starrer A Few Good Men (1992) would be very apt for Surface Season 2. Maybe Jack Nicholson should have shouted, "You can't handle the truth," to some of the characters in the show. The Apple TV+ series starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw revolves around a woman named Sophie trying to figure out her past, present, and future after getting amnesia. This season, Surface moves to England, where buried secrets threaten to take over two families. Sophie (Mbatha-Raw), now going by the name Tess, returns to London, where she tracks individuals who were once close to her, hoping to find out the truth about her past. But as the identities of Sophie and Tess continue to co-mingle, she puts herself and others she comes in contact with in more danger. This involves a journalist named Callum (Gavin Drea) and her estranged husband James (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) as they interact with the secretive but wealthy Huntley family and their heirs Quinn (Phil Dunster) and Eliza (Millie Brady).
