Sriram Raghavan’s Ikkis stands out as an exceptional film and ranks among the finest war films produced in our country. Drawing inspiration from the remarkable true story of India’s youngest Param Vir Chakra recipient, Second Lieutenant Arun Khetrapal, Raghavan has skillfully created a narrative that encourages reflection, emotional engagement, empathy, and makes you admire the craft of film making that takes the road less travelled.
