F1 directed by Joseph Kosinski and written by Ehren Kruge is a film of simpler times. The makers for F1 have chosen to focus on the filmmaking more than its story, but the screenplay doesn't fall short of theatrics and drama. For a story about racing and its team, there is much to offer from conflict between players, past emotional trauma to new beginnings and team bonding. F1 gives almost everything a 2000s film could present with even better direction and cinematography. F1 begins with Brad Pitt as Sonny Hayes stepping in as a nomad driver for hire at a Daytona racetrack for the overnight shift. He takes over the car towards the end of the line, but leads the game by the morning driver change. 5 minutes into the film, the makers clear the air that Sonny Hayes isn't in it for the glory. Despite offers to stay on the team full time, Sonny picks up his cheque and moves on to the next one. Dubbed as "the greatest that never was,” he was Formula 1’s most promising phenom of the 1990s.
