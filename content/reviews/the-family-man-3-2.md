Things are personal this time in The Family Man 3. Everyone is fighting or seeking revenge for a personal loss, and everyone has a clear agenda. Manoj Bajpayee returns to Prime Video’s popular web series The Family Man as the smart, quick on heels and very middle-class Intelligence officer Srikant Tiwari. In the third season, Srikant is finally forced to spend time with his family- and protect them at all costs- while solving an intricate geo-political case and even clearing his name from a crime that he never committed. Naturally, the stakes are high, and The Family Man 3 weaves a very elaborate plot involving some old characters and lots of references from previous seasons.
