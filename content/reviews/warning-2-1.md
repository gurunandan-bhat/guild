Gippy Grewal’s latest Punjabi-language film Warning 2 (2024) picks up the threads from its predecessor Warning (2021), to take forward the revenge action drama. Directed by Amar Hundal, who directed Warning and Babbar (2022), Warning 2 plays to his strengths where he foregrounds slow-motion shots, stylised action choreography featuring tough looking goons, all held together by a threadbare screenplay. Warning left off at the point when Geja (Gippy Grewal) is imprisoned and comes to the same jail as Pamma (Prince Kanwaljit Singh). Geja is the top dog and the whole assortment of gangsters languishing in jail are itching for a chance to prove their worth. Pamma is fascinated by the tales of Geja’s gruesome killings wherein he learns about Geja’s past and how, predictably, he set out to take revenge for his family’s murder, which led him to a life of crime. When the prisoners are being transferred to another location, it presents a golden opportunity for the prisoners as well as the predators circling outside, to seize the opportunity and balance the scales.
