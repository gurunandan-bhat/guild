The retro Apple TV+ series features Kristen Wiig as social climber Maxine Simmons who weaves her way into the Florida society during the Richard Nixon era. Created by Abe Sylvia, this uneven period comedy is enjoyable in parts as long as it remains focused on a few key players. The ten-part series Palm Royale premieres on Apple TV+ from March 20.
