Tehran, directed by Arun Gopalan and produced by Dinesh Vijan, Shobhna Yadav, and Sandeep Leyzell, is another addition to the growing catalogue of Indian espionage thrillers inspired by real-world geopolitical tensions. This one takes on the 2012 attacks on Israeli diplomats, using them as a launchpad for a fictional yet politically steeped narrative set against the volatile backdrop of Iran-Israel hostilities. Over the past decade, John Abraham has become something of a regular fixture in action-diplomatic thrillers â€” and Tehran continues this trajectory. In the role of DCP Rajeev Kumar, Abraham plays a tormented officer who dives headfirst into a complex international conspiracy after a bomb blast in Delhi kills an innocent flower-seller. The event serves as a catalyst, pushing him into an unsanctioned and personal mission of justice.
