We, the post-Independence generation, have grown up listening to or reading this historic speech by India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. But what about the goings-on before that momentous moment of freedom? What led to India breathing free? What made the British leave behind a nation divided into two? Why Nehru, and not Sardar Patel, was chosen to lead India? Why did Mohammad Ali Jinnah, initially a Congressman, turn so bitter as to demand a separate nation for his Muslim brethren? We might know the answers to these in bits and parts, but, as Nikkhil Advani, creator of the immensely watchable and impeccable ‘Rocket Boys’, turns his creative eye to the run-up to India’s tryst with destiny, he creates yet another masterpiece, offering perspective and detail.
