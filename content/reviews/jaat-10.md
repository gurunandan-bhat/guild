Sunny Deol comes out of memes this week, demanding an apology from naysayers. Taking a break from the western front, the original one-man army fires a salvo on the Coromandel coast. When Bollywood takes a break from Muslim terrorists, it reincarnates Ravan to take on the hero. A decade after Shah Rukh Khan rode on Chennai Express, Sunny gets on to a saffronised Ayodhya Express with the thumping chants of Jai Shri Ram playing in the background to take on Ranatunga, a fierce antagonist from Sri Lanka who is ruling a landmass in coastal Andhra with the help of a corrupt system. Sunnyâ€™s father, Dharmendra, uprooted many such Hukumat up north in the 1980s. With the Hindi heartland increasingly becoming out of bounds for mainstream commercial cinema to situate tales of a politician-criminal nexus, Sunny recycles the formula, flexes muscles down South, and shows that even in his 60s, he is the real bulldozer.
