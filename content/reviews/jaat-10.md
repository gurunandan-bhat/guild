Sunny Deol comes out of memes this week, demanding an apology from naysayers. Taking a break from the western front, the original one-man army fires a salvo on the Coromandel coast. When Bollywood takes a break from Muslim terrorists, it reincarnates Ravan to take on the hero. A decade after Shah Rukh Khan rode on Chennai Express, Sunny gets on to a saffronised Ayodhya Express with the thumping chants of Jai Shri Ram playing in the background to take on Ranatunga, a fierce antagonist from Sri Lanka who is ruling a landmass in coastal Andhra with the help of a corrupt system. Sunny’s father, Dharmendra, uprooted many such Hukumat up north in the 1980s. With the Hindi heartland increasingly becoming out of bounds for mainstream commercial cinema to situate tales of a politician-criminal nexus, Sunny recycles the formula, flexes muscles down South, and shows that even in his 60s, he is the real bulldozer.
