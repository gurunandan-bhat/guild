What can be more fascinating than a glimpse into what goes on behind the scenes in the Punjabi music industry? Invariably reverberating with rocking beats, it has deep fault lines that are exposed every now and then. So, can a series helmed by Rohit Jugraj, director of Punjabi films like ‘Sardarji’, its sequel and ‘Jatt James Bond’, truly offer us an expose? Or deep insight? Well, the series, the first season of which dropped in 2023, may not be an unsettling reflection of its grim side, but has its strengths. Before we fault the musical series for unspooling like a thriller in its concluding part, we also need to understand that violence has marred Punjab’s irrepressible musical heart time and again. Thus, this one-of-its-kind musical series fictionalises the brutal killing of Amar Singh Chamkila and moves forward from there. It has violence and revenge running as a recurring thread, not too far away from the truth of the musical world where extortion calls are a norm and gun culture not uncommon.
