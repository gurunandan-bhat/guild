It’s a tough act to follow. But between writer-director Anurag Singh and co-writer Sumit Arora, they faithfully pick the template, don’t mess with it and serve it with renewed vigour. What you would expect from Border 2: A roaring Sunny Deol, introduced in the credits as Dharmendra’s son. The sole survivor from the acting cast of the original Border returns as Lt Col Fateh Singh Kaler, the intervening years irrelevant as the invincible fighter in Sunny remains as ferocious as ever. Fateh Singh exemplifies the main characters. Fierce and fearless on the battlefield, soft and sentimental at home. With the supportive feminine presence of Mona Singh, Sonam Bajwa, Anya Singh and Medha Rana to tug at familial strings.
