While Tom Cruise dangles off World War II biplanes and redefines movie stardom for the 21st century, Salman Khan is celebrated for simply showing up to work. This, in essence, is why our mainstream cinema can never compete. Both Cruise and Salman have attained demi-god status, but at this point, Bhai’s bracelet has a bigger screen presence than him. Watched mere days after Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, Salman’s latest film, Sikandar, feels more disheartening than it may have appeared when it was released in theatres. It’s the most recent example of how mainstream Bollywood is pandering to the audience’s perceived demands, instead of challenging them to keep up. Sikandar is made up of around 500 equally nonsensical plots, which are introduced and executed in 10-minute bursts of maniacal disregard for the tenets of moviemaking. It’s like micro-dosing on Being Human deodorant; you’re going to come out the other side either with a vaguely foreign accent, or you’re going to become obsessed with finding doppelgängers of your ex-partners. Starring Salman as the king Sanjay Rajkot, Sikandar mutilates the very idea of cinema with its ineptly edited, lazily written, and lethargically acted brand of storytelling.
