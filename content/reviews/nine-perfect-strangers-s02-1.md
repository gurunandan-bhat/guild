The first season of the psychological drama anthology Nine Perfect Strangers premiered in 2021, and it was adapted from Liane Moriartyâ€™s novel. This time, creator David E Kelley and star Nicole Kidman, who is back as eccentric wellness guru Masha Dmitrichenko, have nothing new to add. A new group of 'guests,' who are treated more like guinea pigs, are introduced as the action moves to colder climes in the Austrian Alps. While the last season certainly was an undertaking to get through, this new season has been created just because the creators could.
