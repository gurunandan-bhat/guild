When asked about his ear for aspirational sadboi soundtracks, director Mohit Suri correctly deduced that viewers tend to recall the songs from his movies more than the movies themselves. It’s a skill in mainstream Bollywood, of course, especially in an age where Hindi film music is going extinct as a screenwriting and narrative-shaping tool. But the opposite has held true for Suri’s vessels like Zeher (2005), Awarapan (2007), Woh Lamhe (2006), Malang (2020), Hamari Adhuri Kahani (2015) and most of all, Ek Villain (2014); the albums were so addictive that the storytelling often felt like it was biding time and filling space between songs. Aashiqui 2 (2013), that lilting A Star Is Born adaptation, came the closest to being remembered through its tunes, not for it.
