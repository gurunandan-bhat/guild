After wishing death upon Mehek via the Knock Knock app, Tanya is blackmailed by the Knock Knock Killer. She allies with Adheer, and they investigate the mysterious attacks, leading to shocking revelations about her friends and Adheer’s past. The killer is eventually unmasked at a party, and their motivations are revealed as Tanya learns the true extent of the dangerous game she entered. Aadhya Anand is easily the pick of the lot; she genuinely infuses life into her dialogue delivery and expressions, unlike most of her co-stars. Arjun Deswal possesses the ‘hunk’ looks, though his character is notably underdeveloped. Kush Jotwani’s role sparks intrigue occasionally, yet his performance largely lacks significant impact.
