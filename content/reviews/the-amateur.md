Amateur, directed by James Hawes, is a contemporary adaptation of the novel of the same name, which was previously made into a film featuring John Savage and Christopher Plummer. This spy thriller, while not groundbreaking, delivers sufficient thrills. It could easily be likened to a Jason Bourne or Jack Reacher film, but instead, we follow Charlie, the titular Amateur. Unlike James Bond, who possesses a license to kill, Charlie holds a license as a cryptographer for the CIA. With an IQ exceeding 170, he adeptly gathers and synthesizes information from diverse sources, quickly proving his exceptional skills. It is also evident that he is deeply in love with his wife, Sarah (Rachel Brosnahan), and their affection is reciprocated. However, when Sarah embarks on a business rip to London, she never returns, having been taken hostage and subsequently killed.
