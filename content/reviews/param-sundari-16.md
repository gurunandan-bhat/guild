Punjabi ‘munda’ meets Malayali ‘penkutti’ in Param Sundari, and everything happens by the numbers. End of story. Wait, there’s 136 minutes of the film, which struggles to find both the rom and the com, from the beginning to the end, finding its feet only towards the last half an hour. By which time Param (Sidharth Malhotra) and Sundari (Janhvi Kapoor) have finished with their meet-cute in a small Kerala town homestay, gone into the long second act which perks up only when such supporting actors Manjot Singh (hero’s BFF) and Renji Panicker (the heroine’s brusque uncle) show up, finally fetching up at their DDLJ moment, where you can see the spark, fleetingly, between the good-looking leads.
