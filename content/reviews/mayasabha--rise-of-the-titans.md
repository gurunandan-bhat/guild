Created by Deva Katta, the nine-episode drama series Mayasabha - Rise of the Titans is the origin story of two fictional politicians, Kakarla Krishnama Naidu (Aadhi Pinisetty) and MS Rami Reddy (Chaitanya Rao). The series begins in August 1995 and rewinds back two decades to 1975, where the two protagonists begin to take their first steps towards their grand political careers. While largely set in Andhra Pradesh, Mayasabha also involves the national political scene, which dictates state politics. While compelling, the series is the setup for a larger clash in what looks to be season 2. Krishnama Naidu and Rami Reddy come from humble backgrounds and both have to work their way upwards. Naidu is a son of a farmer that pays his own way to college; there he becomes involved in student politics. Meanwhile, Reddy is studying to be a doctor and wants to leave his gangster father, Shiva Reddy's, reputation behind. Their progress in life is shown separately until they meet and form a tentative friendship. It grows over time, but politics is a fickle business. One day you're on top and the next, you're behind bars. The Telugu series follows their rise and fall, along with that of other politicians in their party.
