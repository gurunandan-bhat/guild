The psychological thriller Stephen opens with a chase to find a serial killer responsible for murdering nine women. Filmmaker Mithun's feature twists the tale by revealing the killer early on. The Tamil film is more about Stephen's past and motives that led him to become a cold-blooded killer. As investigators and psychologists probe into his mind, the movie paints a sympathetic picture until that shocking ending. It's a switch and bait that almost works.
