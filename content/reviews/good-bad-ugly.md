Good Bad Ugly once again reiterates that Adhik Ravichandran is perhaps the most campy filmmaker in Tamil cinema today. His eccentric ideas and characters make him one of the most unique voices in the mainstream commercial space, where creative sparks have been dwindling. Sengal Psycho from Trisha Illena Nayanthara, Switch Psycho from Anbanavan Adangadhavan Asaradhavan, and Chiranjeevi from Mark Antony embody the eccentricity that defines Adhik’s sensibilities. For those who can tap into the madness in such writing, the uniqueness of this director, despite its waywardness, becomes thoroughly enjoyable.
