Bhool Chuk Maaf explores the time loop concept for the first time in Bollywood. The concept was rampant in Hollywood movies in early 2000s for chick flicks and made a comeback few years ago with comedy elements. However, Rajkummar Rao's film gives its own spin to it. Still focusing on the social lesson behind it, the film brings along a comedy family entertainer about wedding which is just right for the season. Apart from good performances and comic relief the film's music is also worth visiting theatres for. The film follows Ranjan and Titli's love story and what the two go through to make sure they end up with each other. While Titli's struggle is more based in reality and how women sacrifice in relationships, Ranjan's struggle to win her over is more supernatural. Bhool Chuck Maaf begins with Ranjan and Titli running away from home to get married, but ending up in police station to get permission from their parents. Their wedding in fixed on one condition, Ranjan has to prove he is capable of taking care of Titli by landing a government job. The father-in-law asks for the condition to be met in mere one month, but Titli asking for some consideration lands Ranjan extra 30 days to land the job.
