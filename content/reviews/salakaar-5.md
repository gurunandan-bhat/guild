An Indian spy, Adhir, is on a mission to stop Pakistan’s president, General Zia Ullah, from developing the country’s first nuclear bomb. Many years later, in 2025, he is racing against time to protect an undercover agent, Mariam a.k.a Shrishti, who unearths a dangerous secret about a Pakistani officer, Ashfaq, his past and is making a perilous escape. Naveen Kasturia holds his own as an upright spy who does what it takes to fulfil his duties. He maintains appreciable restraint with his body language, diction, lending authenticity to the portrayal. Mouni Roy’s role, Shrishti, comes with many limitations, while she does her best to rise above them. However, her character could’ve exhibited more agency with her choices, actions.
