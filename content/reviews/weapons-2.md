Weapons movie review & rating: There’s something so eerie about a little girl calmly narrating the events of a horrific night during which, exactly at 2.17 am, seventeen children from the same class got out of their beds, walked out into the dark streets, and vanished, that you don’t want ‘Weapons’ to let you off the hook. Not even for a moment. Writer-director Zach Cregger, anointed the new horror-meister with the 2022 ‘Barbarian’, returns with a small-town-mystery-disappearance which could feel like a trope– so very Stephen Kingian in its thematic concerns- which manages to stay fresh and compelling, but only up until a point.
