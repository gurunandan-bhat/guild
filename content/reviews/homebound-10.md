Does cinema have the power to change? The jury is (perennially) out on that one. Homebound comes close, very close, to providing the answer. For me, the experience of watching this film felt like my heart had been wrenched out of my body, dessicated into a million pieces and put back again. I am still me, but the experience of Homebound makes me feel I am not the same.
