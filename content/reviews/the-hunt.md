Given the censorship wrangles and politicisation of ideas these days, there’s a sense of nostalgia and wonder about watching a seven-episode investigative drama based on the murder of an ex-Prime Minister: no surrogate identities, no fake names, no “inspired by real events” disclaimers. Some of the suspense is self-inflicted; you keep looking for a hint, an agenda, a sign of loose fiction with(in) the facts. There is, after all, always a threat of offending someone, regardless of whose history is portrayed. On that count alone, it’s no small deal that The Hunt: The Rajiv Gandhi Assassination Case exists. The license to tell this particular story is no surprise in 2025, but what matters is the makers’ use of this license. Adapted from former India Today reporter Anirudhya Mitra’s first-person book, Ninety Days, Nagesh Kukunoor’s series sticks to the basics. It explores the SIT’s (Special Investigation Team) nationwide manhunt for the conspirators following the infamous suicide-attack at a Congress rally in Tamil Nadu’s Sriperumbudur in 1991. Headed by CBI officer Kaarthikeyan (the reliable Amit Sial) and operating from Malligai, the team features SP Amit Varma (Sahil Vaid), DSP Ragothaman (Bagavathi ‘Bucks’ Perumal), DIG Amod Kanth (Danish Iqbal), DIG Radhavinod Raju (Girish Sharma) and eventually, NSG Commando Ravindran (Vidyut Garg). Running parallel to their investigation is the widely-known story of the conspirators — the LTTE gang of operatives and sympathisers led by one-eyed mastermind Sivarasan (a locked-in Shafeeq Mustafa) — and their attempts to evade capture. From Madras and Madurai to Delhi and Bangalore, the chase spans safe-houses and tanker escapes, bus-station arrests and stalled raids.
