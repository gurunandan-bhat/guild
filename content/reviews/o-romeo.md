The take-off is like Dhurandhar. As Ustara alias Romeo (Shahid Kapoor) cuts, kills and spills blood all over the place, there’s a peppy ‘Dhak dhak karne laga’ in the background. From a conversation between Jayesh bhai (Nana Patekar), his baap in the gangster business, and the ‘kutiya’ (Shahid), you gather that Romeo is on the run from big bad daddy Jalal (Avinash Tiwary) for murdering his brother. From a spate of energetically executed dances where he breaks into pelvic moves with crude references made to women in the oldest profession in the world, it’s established that Romeo has the swagger of an unremorseful killer-gangster. BTW, ‘Paan ki dukaan’ is catchy.
