Akaal movie review: Known for their bravery and courage despite all odds, the awe-inspiring legends of Sikh warriors have reverberated through the annals of history. Inspired by historical events, Gippy Grewal’s Akaal (2025), starring Grewal, Nimrat Khaira, Gurpreet Ghuggi, and Nikitin Dheer, is the story of a Sikh warrior who protects his village in the face of gruesome attacks by the enemy. With Bollywood embracing a wave of high-octane dramas inspired by mythology and history, it was only a matter of time before Punjabi cinema followed suit. Sharan Art’s Mastaney (2023), starring Tarsem Jassar, captivated audiences with its portrayal of Sikh valour in the face of invading forces in the 18th century, unfolding historical events against a visually captivating backdrop. Written and directed by Grewal, Akaal sets its sights further, which is reflected in the grand scale and detailed execution of the film. Released in Hindi and Punjabi, it also marks the foray of Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions into Punjabi cinema.
