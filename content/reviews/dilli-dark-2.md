If Mumbai feels too real to be cinematic, New Delhi feels too cinematic to be real. Every life is cursed to be a story; every person sounds like a character. Dilli Dark scrutinises these illusions and fictions of the Indian capital through the lens of an outsider. The outsider is Michael Okeke (Samuel Abiola Robinson), a Nigerian national who is trying his darndest to overcome casual racism, transcend his stereotypical African image as a drug peddler named Kevin, and find a real job with his MBA degree. Ironically, his skin tone is an obstacle in a culture that’s so busy playing victim to the first world and massaging its own brown-person complex that it remains oblivious to the third-world gaze it inflicts upon others. It’s a vicious cycle, but Michael’s 6-year relationship with the city comes to a head when he befriends a coke-addicted godwoman (Geetika Vidya Ohylan).
