It’s heart piercing when sole survivor Sepoy Ramlal Yadav (Ankit Siwach) makes it back to camp. But debriefing will be made credible only when the weather clears for facts to be verified. There are certain stories of valour that must be documented and the martyrdom of Major Shaitan Singh (Farhan Akhtar) who defended and saved India’s Chushul airfield from the Chinese, falls into this category. A cinematically unchronicled victory on the 1962 war with China, 120 soldiers put their lives on the line against a 3,000 strong enemy bent upon dining at Chushul the next evening.
