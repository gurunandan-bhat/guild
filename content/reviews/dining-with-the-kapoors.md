Any mention of the Kapoors elicits certain images — a twinkle-toed Raj Kapoor in Mera joota hai Japani, Shammi Kapoor's ducktail hair having a life of its own as he brought every scene and song alive, a boyishly handsome Shashi Kapoor memorably declaring: "Mere paas maa hain" and Rishi Kapoor's infectious smile, easy moves and enviable collection of pullovers.... What also comes to mind when we think of the Kapoors is the clan — across generations — gathering for their annual Christmas lunch, a tradition that the youngsters in the family have made a point to keep alive.
