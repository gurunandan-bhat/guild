I’ll be honest — I had developed superhero fatigue. In fact, a general fatigue for anything big-scale and action-driven on the big screen. A movie that fit that bill was not my obvious choice. And looking at how juggernauts like Coolie (starring Superstar Rajinikanth) and War 2 (with Jr NTR and Hrithik Roshan) received underwhelming responses, it seems I’m not alone. So when I first saw the trailer of Lokah: Chapter 1 — Chandra, my reaction was: “Not the movie I want to watch right now.” Look at the films that have actually struck a chord with audiences recently — without over-the-top marketing or manufactured FOMO. From Tourist Family to Dragon, Thudarum to Hridayapoorvam, and even Soup from So — audiences have embraced heartfelt, emotional stories. That goes against the post-COVID “wisdom” that only large-scale spectacles will sell tickets.
