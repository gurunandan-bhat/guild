The Weitz brothers, Chris and Paul, have adapted Martha Wells' book series Murderbot and given it their unique spin. The Apple TV+ series is also aided by Alexander Skarsgård's fantastic performance about a security robot trained to obey humans. After he hacks his own system and names himself Murderbot, he begins to find himself transformed by the humans around him. The ten-episode series takes a while to grow on you, but once you immerse yourself in its world, you'll find yourself charmed by what you see. Murderbot (Skarsgård) is assigned to protect a crew from the Preservation Alliance who want to explore a more dangerous planet for scientific purposes. The robot tries to hide the fact he has free will, but the presence of an augmented unit, Dr Gurathin (David Dastmalchian), amongst the scientists trips him up. As the situation becomes more dangerous for everyone, with death looming around every corner, the security unit must think fast and use his instincts to survive amongst a group of distrustful humans.
