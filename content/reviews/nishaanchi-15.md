Ah, the age-old tale of twin brothers with identical looks but vastly different values. It's been done to death in Hindi cinema, and yet, here we are again—because why not revisit a classic, right? In Nishaanchi, Anurag Kashyap takes another swing at his Gangs of Wasseypur-like canvas, complete with brotherly brawls, betrayals, love affairs, and the occasional redemption arc. You know, just your typical Bollywood recipe for family dysfunction. Produced by Ajay Rai, Vipin Agnihotri, and Ranjan Singh under JAR Pictures, in collaboration with Flip Films, this film stars newcomer Aaishwary Thackeray alongside Monika Panwar, Vedika Pinto, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, and the inimitable Kumud Mishra. Kashyap once again takes a deep dive into the murky waters of small-town India, where politicians are corrupt, cops are bent, and men are generally itching to pull the trigger. It’s not just about a bullet to the head, though—no, no. The real violence here is much more intimate, and yes, we’re talking about the good ol’ Purabiya slang. Let’s be real: this is not the polite underworld; it's the kind where you need to duck every five seconds.
