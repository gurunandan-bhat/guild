For debutant director Varsha Bharath, 'Bad Girl' is a product of labour and passion. When the teaser was released earlier this year, it was caught in a web of controversies. So much so that the court ordered the makers to remove it from YouTube over its portrayal of Brahmins and young children getting addicted to cigarettes and alcohol (It was later uploaded with minor cuts). But, five minutes into 'Bad Girl', you forget all these controversies and get hooked on the film. That's what a refreshing filmmaking voice does to you! Ramya (Anjali Sivaraman) belongs to an orthodox Brahmin family, where women have to be the primary caregivers. If you have periods, you become untouchable. But Ramya, right from her young age, defies these practices and rebels. And certainly, she earns the wrath of her grandmother and mother, too. Irksome parents, grandparents, pimples, and disciplinarian rules do not and cannot break Ramya.
