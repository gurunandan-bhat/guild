When you hear that a film made ten years ago is getting a long-delayed release, preconceived notions take over. The same set of thoughts emerge: it’ll be dated, it’ll have the small-film-with-a-big-heart syndrome, it’ll be an indie asking for sympathy, it’ll be have intentions than craft. It can be worse when it’s a children’s film — you almost expect it to revolve around a cycle or an unattainable toy or the pursuit of little-things happiness with sad-violin music. Chidiya, too, revolves around two brothers from a Mumbai chawl — 9-year-old Shanu (Svar Kamble) and 5-year-old Bua (Ayush Pathak) — who want to play a game whose name they don’t know. It involves a shuttlecock and two rackets. They spend days trying to hustle together a net, some space, and most of all, some time. Their struggle features a few quirky characters from the neighbourhood. See what I mean?
