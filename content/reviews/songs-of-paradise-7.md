Amongst the most rewarding things about Songs of Paradise, which tells the story of Radio Kashmir’s first female singer, Padmashree Raj Begum (‘inspired by’ is the standard caveat) is watching Saba Azad play the lead role, with pleasing strength and vulnerability. The other is the attention paid to the music, which feels authentic. There’s no Bumro-Bumro over-orchestration, the accompanists keeping to what they need to do. Azad’s Noor Begum comes across as a young woman of the 50s, not an actor trying to do period, the costuming and the body-language feeling as if it could well have belonged to that era. The film opens with a young scholar (Tarruk Raina) trying to interview the older version of Noor, played by the wonderful Soni Razdan. Why, she asks. So that her story may be told to a generation which has forgotten her. In her time and in her kind of conservative Muslim family — her father is tailor who stitches women’s garments, and her mother (Sheeba Chadha, excellent as ever) keeps the home fires burning — there was no question of a ‘respectable girl’ not only singing, but making a profession of it, even if one of the most respected teachers (Shishir Sharma) of ‘mausiki’ thinks that she has a voice which the world needs to hear.
