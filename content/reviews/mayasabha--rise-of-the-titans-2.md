Mayasabha follows the story of two friends who have similar goals to serve the people of the country but their change in ideologies sets them apart and turns them into biggest political rivals of 80s and 90s. The show is based on N. Chandrababu Naidu and Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy's career along with their friendship and personal life, while India is struggling through its own political problems. It is currently streaming on SonyLiv and is led by Aadhi, Chaitanya Rao, Sai Kumar, Divya Dutta among others. The show begins with introduction to each one of the future political leaders, their family and social status years before their career began. Kakarla Krishnama Naidu (based on N. Chandrababu Naidu) is played by Aadhi Pinisetty and is seen being pushed around by people for his ambitions. While his family doesn't understand his need to continue studying or passion for politics, he finds some solace among his friends and peers when he reaches college for PhD.
