War 2, directed by Ayan Mukerji and led by Hrithik Roshan, follows his iconic role, Kabir, going through the dark depths of India's enemies and bringing them to justice while staying hidden in the dark. While Tiger, Pathan often live between the lines of good and bad, Kabir is the baddest, and Jr NTR joins him here on out. One scene in the film also has the latter asking why Kabir often turns heroes into villains and villains into heroes. And an answer to that we will never get, because the next in the franchise might have a similar story again. The film begins with a long introductory action sequence of how much Hrithik Roshan's Kabir has changed and gone bad. He walks into the den of a Japanese mafia alone, subdues their loyal wolf by just looking at him and then proceeds to kill everyone in the entire mansion, or the open corridor, because that's all we get to see. At the end of it, we know one thing for sure: Hrithik Roshan's Japanese has gotten much, much better since we last heard it. Not long after it is followed by another long introductory action sequence for Jr NTR, which portrays him as fit action hero who jumps into enemy lines without parachute, guns or any sort of support to land.
