It seems poetic somehow that Kantara A Legend: Chapter 1 releases in the same month as the 10-year anniversary re-release of Baahubali. Rarely since S.S. Rajamouli’s landscape-defining two-part epic have I felt this level of “how-did-they-pull-that-off” admiration at the absolute conviction, stunning execution, and thunderous scale of an Indian film. Kantara A Legend: Chapter 1—writer-director-star Rishab Shetty’s prequel to his 2022 film, which took the nation by storm,—has all the features of a typical “sequel”. It’s bigger, flashier, more scattered, and less potent. But strictly as a feat of filmmaking and painstaking craft, it’s a thing to marvel at.
