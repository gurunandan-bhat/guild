Kajol stars in Maa, a 2025 Bollywood horror film that blends mythological themes with supernatural suspense, directed by Vishal Furia. Set in the eerie village of Chanderpur, the film follows a mother’s fierce battle against ancient evil to protect her daughter. Featuring standout performances and visual effects, Maa continues the Shaitaan cinematic universe while offering a fresh take on Indian horror. Despite powerful moments, it struggles to sustain emotional impact. Perfect for fans of Indian mythology, psychological thrillers, and dark family dramas, Maa is a bold but uneven entry in Bollywood's evolving horror genre. For decades, Indian filmmakers have treated the theme of "Maa" with the reverence usually reserved for temple bells and home-cooked dal. The maternal muse has inspired more scripts than there are grains of sand on Juhu beach—an exaggeration, perhaps, but only just. In a culture where mothers are venerated both on-screen and off—be they divine deities or domestic dynamos—it’s no wonder filmmakers can’t seem to get enough of her.
