Inheritance directed by Neil Burger of Limitless, Divergent, The Marsh King's Daughter, also brings the similar thrill to the 2025 release. Led by Phoebe Dynevor aka Daphne Bridgerton of the hit Netflix series, the film is a crime drama with thriller elements that manage to keep you hooked. But the film doesn't bring anything new or extraordinary to its genre with its direction or writing. The camera work approach does change things up, but it doesn't change the experience of the film or the story. The film follows a Maya Welsh after the death of her mother, who she had been caring for the last nine months, watching her die. Maya losses her way after the death of her mother, and while her sister is worried about her, Maya jumps at the first chance to reconnect with her estrange father. Sam Welsh is played by Rhys Ifans, best known for his recent Game Of Thrones prequel character Ser Otto Hightower, shows up at the funeral after being out of touch for years. On showing up the first he does is offers a job to his daughter as a real-estate agent in Egypt.
