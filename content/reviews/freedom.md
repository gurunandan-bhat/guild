The early 90s were testing times for Sri Lankans. For those who grew up listening to the gut-wrenching stories of torture and killings amid a civil war. Any story that’s centred on Sri Lanka will always hold high emotional intensity. When a filmmaker crafts a story based on Sri Lanka, political correctness aside, the film should encapsulate the trials and tribulations that the people went through. ‘Freedom’ is one such film which is inspired by true events, which have ample scope to move you, shock you and enthral you. But, did the film manage to make the desired impact? Let’s find out! In 1991, many Sri Lankan refugees sought shelter in Tamil Nadu and were put in camps all across the state. However, when former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated, these refugees became suspects to the police. The police took some of the men and women into the camps for investigation and held them captive at the Vellore Fort. They chose Vellore Fort because of the high walls and trenches surrounding the old fort.
