Abhijeet, a small-town boy, relocates to Mumbai for a high-paying job, struggling with professional ethics and fitting in. His ambition leads to selfish acts, damaging friendships with colleagues Garima, Saurav, and Shruti, resulting in isolation and debt. After a crisis, he rebuilds, facing workplace crises and navigating a complex relationship with Garima, learning the true cost of success. Mihir Ahuja’s ‘chocolate boy’ looks suit his role as an innocent young man trying to find his way in a restless city. His performance is neat, handling the highs and lows of his character with composure. RJ Mahvash has good screen presence, unveiling many layers in her role and sharing a warm camaraderie with Mihir.
