There is a fundamental but very important difference in how we consume food and films. You go in for the same mutton biryani from the same outlet every time because you like how it tastes. If, one day, the taste differs, you will be sorely disappointed, perhaps even making a note to never order from the same restaurant again. How we react to the cinema we like, however, is just the opposite. If you like a film but are presented with almost the same film in its follow-up/sequel, you will reject it. You can look for the same flavour (and perhaps even some familiarity), but you will not appreciate a CtrlC+CtrlV exercise. Raid 2 suffers from this affliction. It is not only a retread into Raid territory, it also doesn't serve its audience anything that we hadn't watched in the first film. Seven years ago, director Rajkumar Gupta gave us Amay Patnaik, a sharp-thinking, quick-on-his-feet income tax officer. Honest to a fault and armed with dry humour, Patnaik's run-in with powerful politician Tauji (a deliciously evil Saurabh Shukla) in what was billed as 'the longest income-tax raid in history', made for some immensely watchable moments, besides delivering the kind of subtle social commentary that Gupta is known for.
