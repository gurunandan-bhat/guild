Haq, the new propaganda movie starring Yami Gautam Dhar and Emraan Hashmi, is even more insidious than. We talk about the film’s harmful stereotypes, the irresponsibility of presenting an entire community as savages, and drawing a direct line between bad behaviour and faith. We also discuss the film’s sloppy storytelling, childish approach to complex ideas, and its constant need to spoon-feed its audience.
