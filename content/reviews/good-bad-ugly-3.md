Days before the massive release of ‘Good Bad Ugly, the makers dropped a fun-max trailer. It was deliciously cut and featured old film references and songs of Ajith Kumar, giving the much-needed high. Naturally, the trailer got the fans excited. After the subdued ‘Vidaamuyarchi’, how exciting would it be to see Ajith Kumar transform into a ‘bad boy’? Did the film deliver what the trailer promised? Let’s find out! AK (Ajith Kumar) plays the invincible gangster Red Dragon in Mumbai. When his wife Ramya (Trisha) gives birth to their son, Vihaan, she refuses to let him touch the baby and instructs him to correct all his mistakes and meet them as Ajith Kumar, not as Red Dragon. For AK, family is of the utmost importance. He quits all his illegal activities and surrenders to the police, agreeing to serve 18 years in prison.
