Four Years Later is a sympathetically crafted and emotionally dense Indo-Australian show that explores the fragility of love stretched across distance and time. Created by Mithila Gupta, who co-directs with Mohini Herse and Fadia Abboud, the Lionsgate Play series follows a long-distance marriage that quietly frays under the pressures of migration and cultural displacement. The English-Hindi language show centres on Sridevi (Shahana Goswami) and Yash (Akshay Ajit Singh). Their story begins in Jaipur. A traditional arranged marriage introduction develops into mutual attraction. Almost immediately after the wedding, Yash departs for Sydney to pursue a medical traineeship, leaving Sri behind to live with his conservative family.
