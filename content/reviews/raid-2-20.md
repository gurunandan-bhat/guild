The income-tax officer who covered himself in glory in Raid gets his knickers into a twist in Raj Kumar Gupta's follow-up to the 2018 hit. But, as is his wont, he does not stop fighting. He hits a rough patch and then schemes to find a way out of the bind. The conventional narrative arc does Raid 2 no good. Irrepressible income tax officer Amay Patnaik's latest adventure adds up to a leaden-footed rigmarole that struggles to find its way out of the plodding grind that it quickly turns into. Raid 2, riding on the star power of Ajay Devgn, buttressed by the presence of Riteish Deshmukh as the antagonist, is a maze of facile contrivances. The outcome does not match the film's ambition and the performances, commendably restrained as they are, fail to offset the drudgery.
