Every stereotype involving Bengalis that you have ever heard, seen and read is heaped in and then hammered into Aap Jaisa Koi. A potentially sweet film with a premise that invariably should have left a lingering aftertaste is sacrificed at the altar of poor research and poorer storytelling. What emerges is a hackneyed, almost hastily put together film that wants to be everything — entertaining, message-y, inspirational, thought-provoking — but ends up being nothing. Except for a "kick in your b\*\*\*s, bro" (that is not me being obscene, but a recurring dialogue in this film). Aap Jaisa Koi, streaming on Netflix, hinges on the idea of a 42-year-old virgin — this one beats Hollywood's The 40-Year-Old Virgin by 730 days — meeting a woman far beyond his dreams (and reach). The 10-year age gap between Shrirenu Tripathi (R. Madhavan, who, in reality, is 55) and Madhu Bose (Fatima Sana Shaikh, 32 in the film, 33 in life) doesn't seem to matter to the two of them. Despite being from different backgrounds, their beats — and not just of the piano that she plays or the sitar that he strums — click in an instant. She is a feisty Bengali woman who teaches French and lives in a joint family in North Calcutta. He still shares a modest apartment with his recently single friend (Namit Das rescues what, on paper, must have been a very annoying character) and teaches Sanskrit in a school in Jamshedpur. Shri's only family comprises his boorish older brother (Manish Chaudhury, forever stereotyped) and neglected sister-in-law (Ayesha Raza Mishra, who helps lift the mediocre film).
