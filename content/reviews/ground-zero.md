A soldier is posted in a communally sensitive region. It’s a thankless and dangerous job. Colleagues die every week. Insurgents and religious fundamentalists lure youngsters into a life of arms and suicide vests. Market places and tourist spots remain unsafe. Gunshots and violent chases are met with a mix of nonchalance and resignation by the locals. This well-respected soldier empathises with the locals because he believes they’re somewhat in the same boat — caught in the crossfire between countries, politicians, perceptions, and narratives. Following a spate of high-profile violence, he becomes an outsider with a conscience. His patriotism is personal: justice for fallen comrades and innocent civilians, a quest for peace, and a distrust for central intelligence agencies and their bureaucratic ways. His mission to nab the mastermind unfolds despite the system, not because of it.
