Gone are the days when feel-good romantic entertainers filled theatres every week. And even when they do, most of them tend to feel flavourless, prompting us to revisit old classics from the '90s and 2000s. When the trailer of ‘Oho Enthan Baby’ was released, it gave the vibe of a vibrant love story that speaks about the relationship troubles of today. Has ‘Oho Enthan Baby’ struck the right chord with the audience? Let’s find out! Ashwin (Rudra), a struggling assistant director, gets the opportunity to narrate his stories to actor Vishnu Vishal (as himself). He is accompanied by his manager, King (Redin Kingsley), who is a sounding board that tells only the truth. Vishnu rejects the first two ideas and asks him to narrate a love story as he hasn’t done one in his career. Ashwin hesitates at first, and then narrates a coming-of-age love story that has an abrupt ending.
