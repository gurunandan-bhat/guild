To call this a review required careful thought. Strictly speaking, it is a re-release — marking a decade since Baahubali: The Beginning first hit theatres in 2015. But this is no ordinary re-release. After undergoing the required technical upgrades to meet current digital projection standards, the 225-minute-long Baahubali: The Epic arrives as a digitally remastered and re-edited film that condenses both parts of the Baahubali saga into a whole.
