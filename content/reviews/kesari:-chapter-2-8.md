As is usually the case, the untold story in Kesari Chapter 2 is actually an inaccurate one wherein history is juggled and chronology is shuffled for the sake of drama. True identities and occurrences are evoked but tweaked beyond recognition to design a chapter in India's pre-Independence era that sounds far more sensational when told through the prism of film-making. So a case of libel becomes a fight against genocide and a devil's advocate transforms into an F-word blasting freedom fighter as fictionalised twists and turns are tossed until an over five-week long courtroom battle acquires the air of a spectacle that's nationalist and cinematic in equal measure.
