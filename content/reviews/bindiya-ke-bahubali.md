The Davans are an influential family in the fictional town of Bindiya, Bihar. With the family patriarch, Bada Davan, in jail, the eldest son, Chhote Davan, tries to seize control of both the empire and local politics. However, his ambitions are threatened by a new colonel, rival gangs, and internal family conflict, all while a dedicated police officer seeks to bring down their criminal enterprise. Saurabh Shukla’s role starts with a bang, but is eventually relegated to the sidelines, and his presence is wasted. Ranvir Shorey looks his part as a son desperate to snatch power in the family, though his performance could’ve benefited from more gravitas. Vineet Kumar and Govvind Namdev get past their roles like a walk in the park; they’re barely challenged.
