An Aamir Khan film is a bit of an anomaly in the current landscape of Hindi cinema. Here’s an actor whose superstar credentials have come not courtesy testosterone-heavy action spectacles but by championing narratives that espouse for a better society and celebrate the inherent goodness of mankind. Good intent, though, doesn’t always translate into an equally good film. Sitaare Zameen Par is that feel-good film that tries so hard to be likeable that it begins to feel cloying and underwhelming. Few jokes fly, many forced. But by the end, it’s pushing for tears. Khan has played this script before, and it’s worked wonders at the box-office. There’s the Rajkumar Hirani-directed 3 Idiots and PK and the Khan banner’s Taare Zameen Par (TZP) and Secret Superstar. Sitaare Zameen Par is cut from the same social-moral fabric. It has even been billed as a spiritual sequel to TZP, only that it feels laborious in execution.
