In an industry dominated by vanity projects, nepo nonsense, and state-sponsored propaganda, nothing is more annoying than a film that aims to impart a ‘message’ to the audience. As with everything else in Hindi cinema, this message is typically delivered at such a volume that Sonu Nigam might take offence. Laxman Utekar’s Mimi concludes not with climactic catharsis, but with a chunk of statistics about adoption. How cinematic. The horror film Chhori, on the other hand, ends with data points about female infanticide. Neither film had enough faith in the audience to know, without being told, that killing babies (or abandoning them) is wrong. It was quite refreshing to discover that the new Amazon Prime Video film Stolen, despite being a ‘message’ movie itself, chooses to let the plot and characters do the talking instead of literal text. Directed by Karan Tejpal, Stolen’s true agenda — and there is an agenda, make no mistake — reveals itself only at the end. This revelation is smartly timed to coincide with the redemption of a truly terrible character, played by Abhishek Banerjee. His name is Gautam, and we first meet him as he’s waiting outside a small-ish railway station for his younger brother, Raman. It’s nighttime, and there’s a wedding in the family the next day. They’re already late because Raman missed his flight and had to take a train instead. At the station, he witnesses a tribal woman’s infant being kidnapped, and moments later, finds himself ensnared in the mess. Gautam’s instinct is to mind his own business and get on with his life, but something — it could be guilt, it could be trauma, or it could just be basic decency — compels Raman to get involved.
