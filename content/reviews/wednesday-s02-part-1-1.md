The quirky and mysterious Addams family is back in Netflix's top show Wednesday for Season 2. In the first half of season two, Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) happily returns to Nevermore Academy, where new mysteries await her. Created by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar, the show also focuses on the rest of the Addams clan, with mother-daughter conflicts and younger sibling woes. After the massive success of its first season, the pressure is on for this next round. The dark comedy manages to tick all the boxes that made it a success the first time around. Rooming with her werewolf bestie, Enid Sinclair (Emma Myers), again, Wednesday is actually pleased to return to school. However, she became a celebrity after saving the school last year and Wednesday doesn't like the attention. The teen doesn't have much time to waste, receiving a premonition of Enid's death and another set of strange murders to solve. This time, she deals with a persistent stalker, some old enemies, and a stubborn mother, Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who wants a progress report on her psychic abilities.
