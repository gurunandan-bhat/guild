Directed by Raj Kumar Gupta of Raid and No One Killed Jessica, much was expected from the film, but it remains surface level. The twists and turns expected from the thriller atmosphere are missing mostly in second half. Like the previous film, this too is reportedly based on real incidents with fictional characters where an Income Tax Department officer uses every trick possible to track down white-collar criminal and bring him to justice. Led by Ajay Devgn as Amay Patnaik IRS, Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax and Riteish Deshmukh as Dada Manohar Bhai. Raid 2 begins with Ajay Devgn's Amay Patnaik taking on a Raja with other government official. However, things don't go as planned when the royal family refuses to cooperate and starts attacking the team. But Patnaik had ready for that too, he waits at the other end of the palace to make sure he finds the money when its being moved around. After confiscating everything he asks for Rs 2 crore as bribe to let go of the money, gold and the charges.
