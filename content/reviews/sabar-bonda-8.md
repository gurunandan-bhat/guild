To enjoy the sweet taste of cactus pears, you must first carefully remove the sharp spines from the skin of the fruit. Rohan Kanawade's debut feature, Sabar Bonda (Cactus Pears) is meant to be savoured exactly like that. For starters, it's a love story of two people who bond during a difficult time. That it showcases a tender relationship between two men is imperative to mention, but the film doesn't make any claims about championing a queer cause. Sabar Bonda is a beautiful and simple film that explores how childhood friends Anand (Bhushaan Manoj) and Balya (Suraj Suman) reunite in the most difficult circumstances when Anand visits his ancestral village following his father's death. While trying to cope with the loss, understanding the rituals and avoiding questions from relatives about getting married, Anand reconnects with Balya. The two talk about life and share warm moments that bring them closer to each other. As the 10-day mourning ends, Anand must decide the fate of this relationship before returning to Mumbai.
