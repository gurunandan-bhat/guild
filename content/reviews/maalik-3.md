In the run-up to its release, Maalik has been promoted as a gangster film with a difference. Gangster film? Yes. With a difference? Not really. The Hindi heartland setting — this time (like all other times) it is Uttar Pradesh — is familiar. So are the players — corrupt politicians, kingmakers, cops without scruples, dime-a-dozen goons....The trajectory of its protagonist-cum-antagonist is, unfortunately, as old (and cold) as the gangster genre itself. With so many seen-there-watched-that elements, Maalik only works in bits and spurts, grounded as it is by a strong, fiery against-type turn from Rajkummar Rao. Rajkummar, with one of his earliest roles being a bit part in Anurag Kashyap's landmark gangster outing Gangs of Wasseypur, plays a farmer's son who lets go off the football at his feet and picks up a gun in his hand when his father (played by Rajendra Gupta) is assaulted by a local goon. Driven by the belief: "Maalik paida nahin huye toh kya, bann toh sakte hain", Deepak soon becomes 'Maalik', with director Pulkit not willing to devote any time into tracing how a simple college boy becomes Allahabad's most dreaded gangster. Despite its long runtime — 152 minutes feels extremely stretched — Maalik doesn't spare much time or thought for any other details as well, and operates on a superficial level, with the action, though gory and visceral, quickly slipping into repetitive territory.
