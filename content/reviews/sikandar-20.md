There’s something pitiable, even desperate, about Sikandar’s attempts to glorify its titular hero. He is Sanjay (Salman Khan), a beloved raja, whose people worship him because of his philanthropic (read ‘being human’) ways. Writer-director A.R. Murugadoss sticks to a bland, predictable template for the narrative. An action sequence, followed by a romantic sequence with wife (Rashmika Mandanna); throw in a song, stir up some random conflict that necessitates an action sequence again where Sikandar, the eternal saviour, rises. The rallying call? “Raja sahab, mujhe bachalo!”. If there’s one flaw in the infallible hero, it’s that he’s got little time for his Mrs. It’s another thing that scenes featuring the Mr and Mrs are entirely devoid of romance or chemistry, making it perhaps one of the most sterile jodis of cinema. Preference for praja over wife comes at a heavy price for the protagonist. Where Murugadoss hopes to make Sikandar stand out in the Bhai genre of films is by showcasing him as a grieving husband and also a Gujarati with a ginormous heart. It’s a load that the stone-faced star struggles with.
