The second season of Wednesday was split into two by Netflix, and the remaining four episodes have too much action and narrative packed in. Created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, with Tim Burton as executive producer and director, Wednesday has a lot going for it, but the story in the latter half of Season 2 is underwhelming despite each twist it throws at you. The makers are determined to involve every single character in its overstuffed plotline, leaving a very exhausted viewer at the end. The fallout from episode four leaves two dangerous fugitives from Willow Hill psychiatric hospital, the Hyde Tyler Galpin (Hunter Doohan) and Slurp (Owen Painter), the zombie that Wednesday's (Jenna Ortega) brother Pugsley (Isaac Cordonez) befriends. Both Addams siblings set out to find them, and it leaves everyone converging towards a wild battle. At Nevermore, Enid (Emma Sinclair) discovers some distressing information about herself, while Principal Dort (Steve Buscemi) is insistent on having a grand gala for the school with possible donor Hester Frump (Joanna Lumley), Wednesday's grandmother.
