Two old friends get together to create a new brand. Of craft beer. In Gurgaon. Troubles pile up. The going doesn’t look as if it will be easy. Stop press. Gotta spill it right here, that the going is so hard that by the end of the first episode (there are eight in all), all I wanted to do was flee. It would have been one thing if this show, the latest offering from Dharmatic, was simply daft. Daftness, well done, can be a lot of fun. But ‘Do You Wanna Partner’ is plain terrible: there’s not one idea or performance that it can grab on to to save itself from going under, and staying there.
