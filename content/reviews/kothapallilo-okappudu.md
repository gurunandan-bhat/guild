Telugu film C/O Kancharapalem, backed by Praveena Paruchuri, is one of my all-time favourite films. Directed by Venkatesh Maha and presented by Rana Daggubati, the film was fresh, innovative, profound, and exhilarating. All at once. With ‘Kothapallilo Okappudu’, Praveena Paruchuri makes her debut as a filmmaker, with Rana backing her once again. The trailer hinted at a quirky satire and a social commentary wrapped in humour. Ramakrishna (Manoj Chandra) works under loan shark Appanna (Ravindra Vijay), who sexualises women at the drop of a hat. Ramakrishna is smitten by his school love Savitri (Monika), who is the granddaughter of Reddy (Benerjee). Benerjee and Appanna are at odds with each other, driven by ego, caste, and privilege. Yet, both are vying to become the dominant force in the village.
