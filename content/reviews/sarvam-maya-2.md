Prabhendu (Nivin Pauly) is an atheist. Belonging to a Namboothiri family of priests, he abandoned this life, along with the sacred thread and its material comforts, to become a dirt-poor musician. Directed by Akhil Sathyan, Sarvam Maya (Everything is an Illusion) puts a quandary to him—what if he sees a ghost? Will he, then, believe in god, believe that things which cannot be sensed can exist and apply pressure on our lives, regardless?
