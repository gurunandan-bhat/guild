There is a lot going for writer-director Umesh Shukla’s new film that strikes a quirky equation between Mamta Mishra (Divya Khossla Kumar) from the slums and suited-booted Abhishek Verma (Neil Nitin Mukesh). And take it from us, there’s nothing romantic going on between them. But what Mamta is all about doesn’t add up. She’s got a kid and a mother-in-law (Chhaya Kadam) who hits the bottle all the time. She’s got a job at the railways and moonlights as a waiter. And the three stay in a locked up little flat, leading the landlord on a merry chase. Along with writers Siddharth Goel, Jay Master, Deepak Nirman and Himanshu Tripathi, Umesh Shukla’s feel for comedy strikes from the first note. But the story really gets going when suave but sleazy Abhishek Verma who’s late for a meeting with a politician (Zakir Hussain), dumps his car that’s stuck in a traffic snarl, jumps into the metro and loses his mobile phone.
