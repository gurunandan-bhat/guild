It’s a fine story to tell. Of youthful enthusiasm, courage, martyrdom, nostalgia and emotions that rule on both sides of the border. It’s also heart-tugging to watch Dharmendra in his last celluloid appearance in a role tailormade for the son-of-the-soil. When he, as long retired Brigadier Madan Lal Khetarpal, sentimentally revisits Sargodha and his family home in Pakistan before the Partition, it is entirely believable. Add to it his recital of a self-penned poem on the draw of his pind (village) and it’s only Dharmendra who could have given such authenticity to the Punjabi with nostalgia flowing unfettered out of him.
