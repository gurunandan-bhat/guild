The bonds between men constitute a sub-genre in Indian cinema. From Anand to Sholay to Dil Chahta Hai to Pyaar Ka Punchnama, these friendships have beguiled generations of viewers. It is fitting that in the 50th anniversary year of Sholay, comes the story of two young men whose story follows familiar beats — deep, abiding affection, a fracture in the friendship, tragedy. And yet, Neeraj Ghaywan’s Homebound is unlike most of these films that have gone before. Because the two men belong to marginalised communities; one is Muslim and the other Dalit. And because the story leads into the pandemic. By the end, I was a weeping mess.
