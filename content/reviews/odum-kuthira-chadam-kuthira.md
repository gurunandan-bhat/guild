Mohanlal’s ‘Hridayapoorvam’, one of the popular Onam releases this year, featured a scene where a fan claiming to know Malayalam cinema talks highly of Fafa aka Fahadh Faasil. He tells Mohanlal, one of the legends of Malayalam cinema, that FaFa is the best. A day later, FaFa’s ‘Odum Kuthira Chadum Kuthira’ hits theatres. You expect everything the fan said. Eyes, expressions, and everything. But Fahadh’s film bores you so much that you contemplate walking out of the theatre. Now, that’s a sentence I never thought I’d say as a critic. The night before the wedding, Nidhi (Kalyani Priyadarshan) tells her fiance Aby Mathre (Fahadh Faasil) about a dream that she has been having for the past few days. Nidhi is a woman who looks at dreams as signs and goes to the extent of realising them. The dream is about Aby arriving at the wedding on a white horse. Aby gives in to her fancies and finds a horse with the help of his coworker Anurag (Anuraj OB).
