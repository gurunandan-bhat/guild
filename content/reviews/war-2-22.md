Let’s begin with a universal truth: a film doesn’t necessarily need a new idea. Sometimes, all it takes is a snazzy new coat of paint, some brooding stares, an international flight or six, and voilà! You have a fresh treatment. Or so one hopes. Enter: War 2. The sequel to 2019’s War has been handed over to Ayan Mukerji, who trades in time travel (Brahmāstra flashbacks, anyone?) for testosterone, tactical, and tight t-shirts. Taking the reins from Siddharth Anand, Mukerji attempts to inject some emotional heft into the franchise, perhaps believing that what this series really needed was… feelings. The result? A three-hour cocktail of high-octane set-pieces, soul-searching monologues, and chase sequences that last longer than most gym memberships.
