The law of diminishing marginal utility is perilously close to catching up with Delhi Crime. The Netflix series, widely regarded as the gold standard in storytelling, and not just in the OTT space, ups the ante in terms of scale — the new season travels from Silchar in Assam to Rohtak in Haryana, with Delhi as its epicentre — and players (Huma Qureshi features as the antagonist this time around), but doesn't offer anything that is remotely novel. Why fix something that ain't broke, you may ask. Truth be told, in this era of increasing competition for viewer eyeballs and decreasing levels of audience attention, bringing in something new, even within the limits of a tried-and-tested format, is #basic.
