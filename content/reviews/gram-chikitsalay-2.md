Dr. Prabhat leaves his city hospital for a neglected rural health centre, only to find the path blocked by farmland. He faces resistance from villagers preferring a quack doctor and uncovers illegal medicine sales within the PHC. Further troubles arise with misplaced vaccines and the strange behaviour of a staff member’s son Sudhir. Amidst political tensions, Prabhat confronts corruption and addresses Sudhir’s mental health while navigating complex village dynamics. Barely a week after the release of Kull, Amol Parashar returns in a contrasting role as a doctor humbled by the eccentricities of a sleepy village. He plays his part with integrity, effectively portraying Prabhat’s internal ambiguities. Vinay Pathak’s brief appearance as a quack doctor who, despite his dubious methods, wins the trust of the locals with warmth, adds authenticity to the narrative.
