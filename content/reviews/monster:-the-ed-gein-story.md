"Only a mother could love you," scolds Ed Gein's mother Augusta (Laurie Metcalf). Ryan Murphy's Monster anthology returns for a third time on Netflix with the story of serial killer and grave robber Ed Gein, who the series would have you believe is the godfather to the rest of the murderers that followed. Charlie Hunnam plays the title role and really sinks into it. However, the screenplay by Ian Brennan is overly indulgent dragging the story over eight episodes and moving it from tangent to tangent.
