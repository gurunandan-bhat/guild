Social media might have bridged the distance between Bollywood stars and the common man, but the curiosity of fans and trolls to look at the view behind the camera remains unsatiated. Over the years, directors Farah Khan, Zoya Akhtar, and Karan Johar have used their access to inside stories to whet this appetite by creating pieces of entertaining cinema and peeping talk shows. Taking this ‘silsila’ forward, debutant Aryan Khan pulls back the curtains and brews an intoxicating concoction of gossip, news, and salacious details in between to mount a sharp take on the movie mafia, as Karan describes Bollywood biggies in the series, and their shenanigans and hypocrisy. Aryan uses his access to his father’s friends and colleagues not to paint a tribute, but to create subversive graffiti. He roasts his father’s friends, plays with their image, spoofs his detractors, and in the end gives the series a climactic twist, a quirk of fate that would make Manmohan Desai proud. The self-awareness of the insider doesn’t become frictional in the rollercoaster ride, and it is what separates Ba\*\*\*ds of Bollywood from Tees Maar Khan of yore, giving it more heft than Om Shanti Om and more colour than Luck By Chance. When the asterisks in Ba\*\*\*ds give way to the letters, the spirit of the series shines through.
