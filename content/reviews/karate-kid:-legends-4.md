The film brings back the hits of the franchise possibly to revive it, but it only brings back some novelty with nostalgia of the 2000s filmmaking similar to Step Up series but with more fighting. Directed by Jonathan Entwistle, the sixth instalment in the franchise has Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio, reprising their roles, while introducing Ben Wang as the main lead alongside Joshua Jackson, Sadie Stanley, and Ming-Na Wen. With a short run time, the film stays focused on the action sequences, but fails to evoke any emotional connection with the characters like the previous films did. It begins with Ben Wang’s Li Fong’s mother announcing that she is moving to New York, after the death of her old son and Li has to come along with her. Li’s brother’s death left the family broken and now, Li isn’t allowed to fight either. His mother’s one rule is ‘No Violence’ and he breaks it the first day back at school. Li makes friend’s with one of the girls who lives in his area and also goes to his new school. She and her father runs the Pizza place, but they also have a connection to fighting. To save their shop Mia’s father decides to enter a street fight competition with a massive winning prize, but after watching Li fight, he wants Li to help him win.
