Ikkis movie review: “Ikkis,” responds a young soldier when asked his age by a senior officer, his face thickly smeared by birthday cake. Twenty-one, when you come properly of age. Second Lt Arun Khetarpal did not live to be 22: he fought with his last breath on that climactic December day of the 1971 Indo-Pak war, becoming the youngest Army officer to be awarded a Param Vir Chakra. Rather than just a straight-up war film about a young man’s exemplary courage, Ikkis is also an exploration of the harrowing fallout of conflict. And that makes Sriram Raghavan’s latest, co-written by him, Arijit Biswas and Pooja Ladha Surti, stand out from the overwhelmingly jingoistic, disturbingly violent features of the past few years.
