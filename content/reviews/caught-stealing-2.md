Darren Aronofsky’s Caught Stealing is a crime thriller with a shot of black comedy. Adapted by author Charlie Huston from his own noir 2004 novel, the film, set in New York City in 1998, follows bartender Hank Thompson, played with remarkable physical and emotional commitment by Butler. Hank was once a promising minor-league baseball player. He now drifts through life as a bartender, carrying teenage trauma and regrets. When a neighbour asks him to look after his pet cat, a seemingly innocent favour propels Hank into a vortex of gangsters, corrupt cops and psychotic debt collectors. What begins as a noir caper unfurls into an Aronofsky psychodrama: a man’s descent into chaos, filmed with a feverish intimacy that’s both thrilling and affecting.
