The film begins with a flashback of a small lost bear who goes missing after chasing an orange and falling into a river. But the story begins with Paddington receiving his British passport. To celebrate, he writes a letter to his aunt Lucy about how the city and the Browns have changed since the last time they met. He talks about how the kids have grown up while the parents are hoping to spend more time with each other. Despite the changes and the world growing apart, Paddington still enjoys his life in London. He soon finds out that his aunt has been in bad health from the mother reverend at the home for retired bears. Worried for her, Paddington decides to go to Peri to check on her, and the family agrees to join him. With the new passport and Mr. Brown's new boss urging him to take risks, the family takes the risk to spend more time together before the kids start their separate lives at college. The trip isnâ€™t as easy as they expected it to be, as after landing in Peru, they find out Aunt Lucy has gone missing.
