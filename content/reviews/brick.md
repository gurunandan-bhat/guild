A German film is fast climbing the global charts on Netflix. Brick, a sci-fi thriller that also doubles as a relationship drama, is the latest addition to the puzzle-box/ escape room movie sub-genre, that over the last few decades, has met with middling success. Brick tells the story of a group of tenants who become trapped inside their building when a mysterious, almost alien-like black brick wall 'grows' overnight outside their apartments, completely surrounding it. The wall is impenetrable, its strong magnetic energy even managing to make bullets ricochet off it and kill those it has trapped within their four walls. There is no way to escape, and as the minutes tick by, the group finds that the Internet is down, their phones are out and the water supply has run dry (though the electricity, inexplicably, seems to be still working).
