After Santosh, The Apprentice is the second film releasing on Lionsgate Play that didn't receive a theatrical release in India because of censor issues. Ali Abbasi's Donald Trump biopic The Apprentice is almost overshadowed by another man, Jeremy Strong's Roy Cohn. Set in the 1970s, the drama follows young Donny's journey into becoming Donald Trump, ably played by Sebastian Stan, who subtly gives glimpses of the businessman and future president used to cutting corners to get ahead.
