The Morning Show was launched in 2019 as a vehicle for stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. The show also reflected on the changing landscape of TV journalism with topical issues like the MeToo movement, the COVID-19 pandemic, and even the January 6th riots at the Capitol. This season, the Apple TV+ returns with a focus on the 2024 Olympics in Paris while also tackling AI (artificial intelligence). Already crowded with pending storylines, The Morning Show adds fuel to the fire by introducing several new conflicts for its burdened characters. Alex Levy (Aniston) and Bradley Jackson (Witherspoon) have survived the events of the last season of The Morning Show. The new season returns two years after the events of the last, with Alex as a top executive at the new UBN network and Bradley seemingly retired as a journalist. So what reunites the two again? The TV anchors face it all this time around with deepfakes, conspiracy theories, and corporate cover-ups that keep threatening them and those around them. The stakes are even higher, as this time the two women battle a hidden enemy.
