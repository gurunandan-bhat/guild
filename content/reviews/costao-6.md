In 1990s Goa, a determined customs officer, Costao Fernandes, wages a fierce battle against a large gold smuggling network. His pursuit of justice thrusts him into dangerous situations. A confrontation with the smugglers leads to a death, and Costao is subsequently accused of murder. How does he stay committed to his duty amidst the heavy personal toll in his fight against corruption in Goa? Nawazuddin Siddiqui is the lifeline of the film, who uses dialogues and body language to masterfully depict his fiery yet underplayed arrogance. However, he needed a more engaging script to sink his teeth into. Priya Bapat is as reliable as ever, winning your empathy while cast as a responsible wife who prioritises her family over anything else.
