A whole lot of nothing happens in Season 2 of Rana Naidu, the Indian adaptation of Ray Donovan. The first season (2023) was populist and provocative for the heck of it, what with its look-maa-sex-gore-expletives rhythms. But at least it was a world-building phase, where fan service prevailed (the casting coup of a star uncle-nephew duo) and viewers could be introduced to the concept of a badass Hyderabadi “fixer” in Mumbai, his daddy issues, and the endless struggle to fix his own family. It was like watching a celebrity gossip column posing as an OTT-template action thriller. A slog, but a new one.
