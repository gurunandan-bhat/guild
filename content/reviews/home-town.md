Prasad, father to teenagers Jyothi and Srikanth, runs a small-time photo studio in a quaint town in Telangana, struggling to make ends meet. Yet, he does it all without complaints, helped significantly by his homemaker wife Devi. While Srikanth wants to work in films, Prasad is adamant about sending him to the US. In contrast, Jyothi wants to study further, but her parents try to get her married. The casting, while familiar, still evokes some freshness with the pairing of Rajeev Kanakala and Jhansi. As expected of him, Rajeev Kanakala fits the part of the seemingly tough dad with a heart of gold and delivers a warm, affecting performance with a good sense of humour and use of body language. Jhansi is as expressive as ever, acing the Telangana slang like a queen without missing the core emotion of the character.
