The film begins with a quick narration by Steve, his motivation and reason for being the lead in the Minecraft movie. Steve was also interested in mining, but as a kid, he wasn’t allowed to go near mines. After being chased away, he the a terrible thing that he shouldn’t have, he grew up. Like it often happens with adulting, though his clothes and hair remained the same, he was left soulless. But one day he rediscovered his passion for the mines, and as an adult, he was no longer chased away from the mines. He finally decides to fulfill his wishes and goes to the town’s mine and mines to his heart’s content until he finds two glowing cubes. The cubes then lead him to the Overworld, a place filled with creativity. Steve spends a year with his wolf, Dennis, in the Overworld building new places, mining and gathering things. When he finds another Orb, it leads him to the Netherworld ruled by a dark lord who only wants gold and mines to take over the Overworld as well. In an attempt to his the Orb from her, Steve sends Dennis to the real world to hide the Orb. It eventually lands in the hands of a teenager and a failing arcade owner.
