When the first Avatar was released in 2009, filmmaker James Cameron introduced the world to the wonders of Pandora. The VIsual effects in the film, and the world that Cameron created, were a watershed moment for Cinema at large as many witnessed the greatness of CGI and how it makes films visually rich. It became an inspiration for makers worldwide as they explored realism and alternate universes and worlds in their stories. Cameron captured the imagination of the audience by introducing Pandora and its people, called Na’vi. Alien-like blue creatures who welcomed Jake Sully -one from the Sky people- humans- into their own as he fell deep in love with Na’vi princess Naytiri. Cameron returns to the big screen this Friday with Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third instalment in the franchise, hoping to tap on the love that the previous two films had received. But is the film a worthy sequel in the franchise?
