Anaconda movie review: Help, the ssssnake is back. Not just any old wriggly creature, but the giant anaconda, which is out hunting humans again in the jungles of South America. Those who’ve seen the 1997 original, starring Jennifer Lopez-Owen Wilson-Jon Voight-Ice Cube and the reptile with a monstrous maw, will remember just how scary it was. The relentless chase– this is a snake which hunts in water, over land, and on tall tree-tops– was all kinds of scary with people falling off boats, thrashing in the jaws of the snake, turning the water bloody.
