Patriarchy has long served as a veil, obscuring women’s path to greatness. When Rashmika Mandanna's Bhooma finally sheds her dupatta in 'The Girlfriend,' it's more than fabric falling – it's two decades of patriarchal conditioning unravelling. This deliberate act of stripping away the cloth – a constant element of her attire throughout the film – is a profound declaration of reclaiming her freedom and her rejection of the chains that once held her captive.
