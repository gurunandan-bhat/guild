Deep into the second season of Pachinko—the generation-spanning Apple TV+ drama series that rightfully captured hearts and won several awards upon its debut almost two-and-a-half years ago—the ruthless man of many trades, Koh Hansu (Lee Minho), utters eight words that unfortunately underpin the show: “For people like us, there is no home.” The lives of Pachinko’s characters have always been ravaged by war. First, they were made to feel lesser than and uprooted from their homeland. And since then, they’ve found themselves stuck in a world—as Koreans in Japan—that won’t really accept them no matter how much they give to it. The longing for home, the desire to feel safe and settled, and a quest for solace have defined their existence.
