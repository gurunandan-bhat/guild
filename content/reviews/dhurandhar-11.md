India and Pakistan are neighbours, and much like how things work in our colonies and housing complexes, we are always more curious about what happens next door. Our fascination with a distant relative doing well is not very different from the interest many Indians showed in Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York. Dhurandhar taps into this instinct, which makes its obsession with Pakistani politics immediately relatable. Pakistan’s activities, specially the extremist ones, have historically brushed directly against India. Aditya Dhar uses these shared touchpoints of language, culture, art, and sport to craft a story that feels rooted in reality yet remains thoroughly cinematic and engaging.
