Credit where it's due: Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri makes the most interactive Hindi films imaginable. One of the discreet pleasures of watching his Files trilogy — Bengal was preceded by Kashmir and Tashkent — in theatres is also listening in on the audience chatter. His films coast on a call-and-response strategy that I find uniquely fascinating. There are pauses built into the narrative for the viewer to gasp and react—in horror, in indignation. Ideologically, these films are crude and convenient monologues; as a piece of communal theatre, though, they're a dialogue! My morning screening of The Bengal Files at a suburban multiplex in Mumbai was by no means a muted experience. When a hopeful and patriotic man, circa 1946, announces optimistically that Calcutta will be never become a 'Muslim' city, an elderly lady three rows from me ad-libbed sarcastically, "Of course it wont". On Mahatma Gandhi hawking his spiel of non-violence as Hindus are butchered in the streets: "What an a\*\*hole". And a little earlier, when a Sikh character enters the narrative, this priceless enquiry to the screen: "What is a sardar doing in Bengal?"
