When a prince of a dippy, strapped-for-cash royal family meets a pushy possessor of a hospitality start-up, foreplay makes way for a financially profitable proposition. Creator Rangita Pritish Nandy's modern-day fairy tale, directed by Priyanka Ghose and Nupur Asthana, is tailor-made for rom-com vibes. While the makers embellish the couple's 'blow hot and cold' equation with ample of visual razzmatazz, their wet blanket chemistry and dowdily-crafted scenes of 'opposites attract' prove to be a buzzkill for its eight scatterbrained episodes. Add to that a cliffhanger ending and unresolved issues that follow once skeletons pop out of the closet, the prolonging seems unwarranted.
