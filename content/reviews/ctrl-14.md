Vikramaditya Motwane’s fascination with genre cinema continues. But his latest film, CTRL, isn't exactly going to win him any new fans. We discuss the film’s mess of a script, which tries to cram in way too many ideas than it needed to. We also talk about its elaborate conspiracy thriller section and its melancholic third act. Along the way, we praise Ananya Panday for bringing nuance to a string of performances that could be misinterpreted as belonging to the same category.
