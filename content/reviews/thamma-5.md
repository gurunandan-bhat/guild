Sinking its teeth — pun fully intended — into the horror-comedy universe is Thamma. Spawned by Stree in 2018, whose super success so far has led to the creation of one sequel (Stree 2) and two connected verticals (Bhediya, Munjya), Thamma is the latest in this multiverse which has now acquired the name MHCU (Maddock Horror Comedy Universe), which, of course — tongue firmly in cheek — is not to be confused with the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).
