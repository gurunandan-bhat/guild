More than midway through The Instigators—the Apple TV+ original movie with Matt Damon and Casey Affleck in the lead—a black trashed-up BMW is chased through the streets of Boston by cop cars from Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Inside the fugitive vehicle, as Petula Clark’s 1964 global hit “Downtown” blares off the speakers, a well-meaning psychiatrist attempts to counsel her dispirited patient while he’s actively evading the police. In the back, a super talkative sot is incessantly cracking jokes, providing unnecessary commentary or interrupting the doctor-patient exchange. But all the driver wants is for someone to change the song. It’s the funniest high-speed car chase I’ve seen in a film in years.
