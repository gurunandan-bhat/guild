'Veduvan', now streaming on Zee5, throws us into the life of Sooraj, an aspiring actor who unexpectedly lands a lead role in a film about Arun, a cop with a controversial reputation for encounter killings. It’s a classic case of life imitating art, as Sooraj digs into Arun’s world - not just as research for a part, but in a way that starts to affect him deeply.
