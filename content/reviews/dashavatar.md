In the Konkan region of Maharashtra, Dashavatar presentations continue to be a huge draw. The traditional theatre form is centred around the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu, and its performers command immense respect and popularity. Subodh Khanolkar’s Dashavatar is the story of one such performer – Babuli Mestri (Dilip Prabhavalkar).
Having performed in the traditional theatre all his life, Babuli is almost synonymous to Dashavatar in his village, so much that his entry in the presentation is all that people look forward to. Age is fast catching up with Babuli, but he refuses to hang his boots despite repeated pleas from his doctor and even his son Madhav (Siddharth Menon). Babuli promises to retire only when Madhav gets a job and starts earning. When that happens, the veteran performer stays true to his word and announces his last performance during a Mahashivratri celebration. On the other hand, Madhav also decides to ask for his girlfriend Vandana’s (Priyadarshini Indalkar) hand in marriage on the auspicious day. But tragedy strikes, derailing everyone’s plans and putting in motion a series of entirely unexpected events.
