What happens when a simple, calm, composed man commits a crime out of helplessness? Is the crime justified? Does the man repent? Does he get caught? Devmanus answers all these questions and does it while keeping you hooked. An adaptation of Jaspal Singh Sandhu and Rajeev Barnwal’s Hindi film Vadh, Devmanus sees Mahesh Manjrekar and Renuka Shahane stepping into Sanjay Mishra and Neena Gupta’s roles. The film is a thrilling drama that packs all the right punches – stellar performances, a gripping story, beautiful shots, taut editing and a fitting background score. Owing money to a loan shark, Keshav (Mahesh Manjrekar) and Laxmi (Renuka Shahane) are struggling to make ends meet. The impending tension of losing their mortgaged house makes the couple helpless as Dilip (Siddharth Bodke), the goon who they’ve taken the money from, shows up drunk at their doorstep anytime he wishes to. Things take a drastic turn one day and the lives of Keshav and Laxmi change forever.
