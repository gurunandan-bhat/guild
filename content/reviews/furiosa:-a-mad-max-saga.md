Less than an hour into Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga—the franchise’s first prequel, first spin-off, and first movie centred on a woman—the audience is treated to a 15-minute ultra-complex action sequence. In it, a young Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy), who has hidden herself to escape the brutal and captive life she’s known, is caught in a raid on a newly built War Rig. It’s a giant of a thing—an all-wheel drive truck pulling a chrome-plated tanker, with a rail on top that allows men to defend it, and two digger arms attached to the side to deal with nuisances. The scene is even more fascinating. What begins as a parasail wing shooting out of a motorcycle is just the start. It has countless moving parts—the multiple fliers add dynamism to the set piece—and yet it’s all coherent and easy to follow.
