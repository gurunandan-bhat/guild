Maria Callas was an infamous opera singer known as one of the most renowned sopranos of the 20th century. Directed by Pablo Larrain of Spencer on Princess Diana and Jackie on Jacqueline Kennedy, this too does not disappoint with its storytelling and cinematography. Maria, is the third film by Pablo about an influential female public figure and it does not attempt to life the character or break it down. Instead we get a look into what little we know of the finale days of her life and career. The film follows the seven days before her death in Paris in 1977, as she reflects on her life and career.
