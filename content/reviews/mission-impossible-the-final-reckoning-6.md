So. That ending. If your jaw is still somewhere on the floor after watching Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, you are not alone. There’s no denying it: the final act of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning and especially its ending has left us with more questions than answers, even though it is supposed to be the full stop in this venerable spy-thriller franchise. Let’s dive into Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning plot, ending, which is explained here, the cast of this Tom Cruise-led film, and more. The movie finds Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his crew of IMF (Impossible Missions Force) agents discussing how to deal with the Entity, an all-powerful and all-encompassing artificial intelligence that has gone rogue and sentient. Now, it threatens the destruction of humanity by taking over the global cyberspace.
