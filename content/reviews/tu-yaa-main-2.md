“Don’t romanticize my poverty to me,” says Maruti Kadam (Adarsh Gourav) to his ultra-rich influencer girlfriend Avani (Shanaya Kapoor) in Bejoy Nambiar’s Tu Yaa Main. It’s a laugh-out-loud line, but it carries the weight of a boy who has watched his world stagnate inside a 10×10 shanty. Avani, alias Miss Vanity, with her multi-million-following, likes to believe that money can’t buy happiness – who, perhaps, is one Virar-to-Churchgate local train ride away from abandoning philosophy to retreat to her plush Juhu pad. For Maruti alias Aala Flowpara, whose sister takes Marathi tuition and whose mother sells snacks to local shops, money is indispensable. He wouldn’t mind a richer life or a richer girlfriend if it widens his comfort zone.
