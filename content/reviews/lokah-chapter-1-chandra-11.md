Lokah Chapter 1: Chandra is perhaps the most overrated Indian movie of the year. We discuss the film’s inert narrative, jarring action, and inelegant world-building that includes an unnecessary detour into Kantara territory. We also talk about where the franchise could head next, and why it would immediately be better if merged with the universe.
