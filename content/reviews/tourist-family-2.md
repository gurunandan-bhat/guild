Tired of watching guns, gore and blood splashing all over the big screen? Are you obsessed with films featuring hardcore action and violence and looking for a breather? Have you ever thought about wanting to watch a no-fuss film that reminds you to look for goodness in people? If a film can put a smile on your face this weekend and offer you some respite, it is director Abishan Jeevinth’s ‘Tourist Family’. Dharmadas (Sasikumar), the epitome of ever-helping Mr Goody Two-Shoes, and his wife Vasanthi (Simran), along with their two children Nithushan (Mithun Jai Sankar) and Mulli (Kamalesh) are Sri Lankan natives who illegally hop on a boat to enter India. They end up in Dhanushkodi, only to be caught by the police. But, the innocence and sharp presence of mind of Mulli help them escape.
