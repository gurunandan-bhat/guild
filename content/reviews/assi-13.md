There is a scene in Anubhav Sinha’s Assi, a social drama in the shape of legal deliberation, where a female lawyer gets into a heated argument with a male police officer. There is a context here: rape. In Delhi, a woman was gangraped and the accused, four till then, systematically erased and misled evidence. Frustrated, the cop gets hold of an accomplice and threatens to get a confession. Seeing this, the lawyer, representing the survivor, erupts. “You think only you are angry?” she charges at him. “We are so angry that we can burn the world. We just don’t want to.” In many ways, the speaker, Raavi (Taapsee Pannu), is the film’s chosen voice, yet Sinha’s work, too, is dipping with rage.
