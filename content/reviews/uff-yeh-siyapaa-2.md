A film scored by A R Rahman, no less, cannot, in all honesty, be called a silent film. It can also be a big reason for drawing us into a film labelled a silent comedy, because music is key to telling us what words cannot. But looks can be deceptive. Let me warn you, this is two hours of drivel. How on God’s good earth did Rahman get inveigled into a project so vacuous? That’s a mystery which is destined to go unsolved; meanwhile, let me inflict upon you the misery I had to undergo.
