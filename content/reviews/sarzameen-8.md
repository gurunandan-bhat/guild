An army man sworn to protect his country at any cost. Even if the cost is his young son’s life. It resembles the premise of the Dilip Kumar-Amitabh Bachchan starrer Shakti (1982), tautly directed by Ramesh Sippy. Dilip Kumar had played uncompromising DCP Ashwini Kumar who wouldn’t negotiate with a gangster even if it meant endangering son Vijay’s life. Vijay, played by Amitabh Bachchan, had grown up resenting his father and had purposefully walked off in the opposite direction – to the world of crime. Travel to a troubled Kashmir in the 90s and transplant the Shakti theme against an Indo-Pak backdrop, with Soumil Shukla and Arun Singh (along with Kausar Munir and Jehan Handa) taking credit for story, screenplay and dialogues. After running to the rescue of his men who’ve walked into a trap, a fierce exchange of fire and much hand-to-hand combat, staunch army man Vijay Menon (Prithviraj Sukumaran) captures dreaded brothers Qaabil (KC Shankar) and Aabil (Rohed Khan). But when his own son Harman (Ronav Parihar) is nabbed, Vijay faces the toughest decision of his life – release the terror brothers who are wreaking havoc in the valley in exchange for his son?
