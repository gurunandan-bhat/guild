Punjabi cinema and comedy are a match made in blockbuster heaven and Ammy Virkâ€™s latest film, Saunkan Saunkanay 2, directed by Smeep Kang seems to be headed that way. The blockbuster success of Saunkan Saunkne (2022) precipitated this sequel, featuring the returning star cast of Nimrat Khaira, Sargun Mehta (in a double role) and Nirmal Rishi. Written by Amberdeep Singh, the film features the marital life of Nirmal Singh (Ammy Virk), which is complicated even further, as completely fed up with his existing two wives, he starts thinking of the possibility of a third!
