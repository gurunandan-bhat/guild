It’s not every day that Hindi film audiences get to see a creature spread fear and panic. Of late, Maddock’s horror comedies have shown the appeal of creating a worthy nemesis with the Stree films and Munjya. Bejoy Nambiar’s Tu Yaa Main reminds us why we love to fear the croc in a survival thriller. After all, when it comes to sleek killing machines, it doesn’t get better than the cold-blooded amphibious reptile. Tu Yaa Main starts out as a love story between two Gen Z creators. The girl’s (Shanaya Kapoor) famous, rich and privileged; the boy’s (Adarsh Gourav) from Nalasopara and lives in a crammed house with his family. She’s sophisticated; he’s the boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Opposites attract, suggests Nambiar, as he sets out to establish why despite their differences they are MFEO (made for each other).
