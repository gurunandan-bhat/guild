Homebound, Neeraj Ghaywan’s second feature film in a decade, is well worth the wait. Already selected as India’s official entry for the 2026 Oscars, Homebound is just as moving as Ghaywan’s widely admired debut film, Masaan. We discuss its poetic storytelling, deeply empathetic eye, and the fabulous central performances of Vishal Jethwa and Ishaan Khatter. We also talk about its daring, humanist approach to spotlighting minority communities, and how a tragedy like the COVID-19 pandemic affected them. Later in the episode, we discuss the film’s chances at the Oscars.
