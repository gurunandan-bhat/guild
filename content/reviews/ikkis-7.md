There's a wistfulness about Ikkis, a period action drama based on the life of India's youngest Param Vir Chakra awardee, Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal. The 21-year-old Indian army officer was immortalised during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war; the film outlines his undying sense of duty. But the wistfulness is something we’ve come to associate with brave love stories. I last felt it after Merry Christmas, Sriram Raghavan’s soft-hearted romantic thriller rooted in war-coded emotions like sacrifice, guilt, rage, deceit, redemption, heroism and loyalty. Raghavan’s Ikkis (“21”) is a war movie rooted in love-coded emotions: longing, regret, naivety, mutual respect, trust, compassion and hope. Beneath all the bullets and armour, it’s a tender and kind film — one that reclaims patriotism as the quest for humanity, not identity or faith. I went in expecting a reverential biopic, but came out thinking of Yash Chopra and other vintage legacies of cross-border nostalgia. It’s a story in which soldiers aren’t killed; humans die. It’s a post-partition tragedy in which two nations are united by memory and divided by borders. In other words, Ikkis is a minor miracle in a genre landscape that often sells valour in the currency of hate and victimhood. It’s hard not to feel protective of it.
