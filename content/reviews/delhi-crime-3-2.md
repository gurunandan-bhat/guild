When the first season of Delhi Crime was released on Netflix back in 2022, the series, however much difficult it was to watch, won over the audience for its raw and authentic portrayal of a case that had shocked the entire world. The Nirbhaya gang rape case, formed the base of the Delhi Crime plot and director Richie Mehta presented a very real picture of how the case was first ignored by the Delhi Police and then cracked. The show opened up a new genre of thriller for the Indian audience- one which feels almost real and yet is fictionalised. It also gave us a new heroine, supercop Vertika Singh – played by Shefali Shah- a no-nonsense, honest police officer with a sharp mind, calm demeanour and one who brings apathy into the otherwise cold, corrupt Police force. Vartika Singh comes back in Delhi Crime Season ,3 and while her core characteristics are intact, she is now more hardened – perhaps due to circumstances or age. Vartika is now posted in Silchar, Assa,m but a case of human trafficking and search for a certain Badi Didi (Huma Quereshi) brings her back to the national capital.
