The show has returned for a new season with a new story that explores another crime. Directed by Rohan Sippy, the season 4 follows another criminal case taken on by Pankaj Tripathi's character, Madhav Mishra. Mishra is known for fighting against injustice and for his clients, but this time, instead of taking a pro bono case, he finally accepts a case from a wealthy client. Even though it puts him at odds with a high-paying consultant job, Mishra decides to stick by his client and do justice to him. Season 4 does take a different path as compared to the plots in previous seasons, but Mishra hasn't changed, which keeps the audience rooted in the story. Season 4 begins with Mishra taking on a consulting job for a big law firm to keep up with his status. The first case he is asked to be part of has him convincing the victim to settle, as it would be in his best interest. With a small settlement amount, Mishra begins to learn how the big companies work, however, it doesn't sit well with him. On the other hand, Anju Nagpal wants Mishra to take on her husband's case as is getting arrested by the cops for his girlfriend's murder. Anju who lives right across walked in on Raj Nagpal holding a bleeding body of his GF Roshini after hearing their maid's distressed scream.
