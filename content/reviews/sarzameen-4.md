If I downed a tequila shot every time someone uttered 'sarzameen' in, well, 'Sarzameen', I would be drunk till the time Ibrahim Ali Khan became a good actor. Which, going by how things stand at the moment, is a 'naadaan' (iyan) thought. To be fair, Ibrahim does show some improvement from his debut a few months ago — which was more of a face-meets-palm moment than a jaw-drops-to-floor experience for we the viewers — but Sarzameen, now streaming on JioHotstar, is such a patience-testing assault-on-the-eardrums kind of film that you end up feeling that Saif Ali Khan's son — along with principal actors Prithviraj Sukumaran and Kajol (credited as Kajol Devgan here) — is the one who has got the raw end of the stick. Sarzameen — though set in the familiar territory of Kashmir-based insurgency and the tense battle in the valley between the Indian army and state-sponsored terrorism — could have made for a riveting watch, at least given the names involved. Karan Johar's Dharma Productions is the producer, while Kayoze Irani — actor Boman Irani's son — makes his directorial debut.
