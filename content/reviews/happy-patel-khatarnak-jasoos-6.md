Those who have followed Vir Das’ comedy specials would know that he blends satire with observational humour better than most. He voices the experiences of the misfits, and his skits capture everyday absurdities arising from cultural clashes, racism, and jingoism. This week, Vir shifts stage, turning his pet peeves into an irreverent and frenetic parody of our times. Making his debut as a director, he turns up ‘in and as’ Happy Patel, a clumsy British spy with Indian roots. More at ease in the culinary terrain, perhaps because of his genetic composition, than picking clues, Happy is sent on a mission to Goa to rescue a British scientist from the clutches of a vicious crime lord, Mama (Mona Singh). Her favourite recipe is ‘cut-let’ and she is seeking a formula for fair skin. Happy mispronounces Hindi, and here lies most of the ingenuity in writing. Tum (you) becomes Tom and so on. On his crazy hunt for Mama, he rhymes with his Sikh handler (Sharib Hashmi) and loses his tasting finger to Mama and his heart to dancer Rupa (Mithila Palkar).
