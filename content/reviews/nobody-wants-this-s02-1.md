A year after the world fell in love with agnostic podcast host Joanne (Kristen Bell) and hot rabbi Noah (Adam Brody), the Netflix series Nobody Wants This is back to check in on the couple. Erin Foster's series about an interfaith couple struck a chord with audiences. With its new season, it's time to see whether Joanne and Noah can make it work despite their differences. While the rom-com gets candid for several characters, it also keeps circling around the same issue for the main couple.
