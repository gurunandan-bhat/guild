It’s Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) who saves the world from The Entity, a disastrous AI creation that’s about to fall into the dirty hands of Gabriel (Esai Morales). On screen, it’s Tom Cruise, all by himself, who saves director Christopher McQuarrie’s story-less adventure from nosediving like his planes do in an action sequence. Cruise is still watchable at 60+ especially since performing his own stunts continues to be one of the main attractions of the franchise. Mid-air heroics as Ethan grasps to hold on to a plane or two and aqua thrills as he gasps for breath underwater, are the two adrenaline pumpers of writers Bruce Geller, Erik Jendresen and McQuarrie’s rudderless tale. An acceptable add-on is a finale that runs on four high-drama parallel tracks. Hunt chasing planes and Gabriel is intercut with a seriously wounded Simon (Benji Dunn) as he instructs Grace (Hayley Atwell) and team to simultaneously patch him up and detonate a bomb. On the third line is another team taking care of another blast-ready part of The Entity and the fourth is at the White House where Madam President (Angela Bassett) plays the great American fantasy of a woman, that too black, showing who’s the boss taking the right decisions in the nick of time. To save humanity, of course.
