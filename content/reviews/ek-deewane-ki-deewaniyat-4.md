Milap Zaveri's Ek Deewane Ki Deewaniyat is the worst film of the year. I say this knowing that there are a few months left, that art is subjective, and the response it evokes is objective. I also say this because there is more strategy than heart involved in the making, and despite every tear and slo-mo being curated for cheers, Zaveriâ€™s new work is gratuitous, concerning, and I will go out on a limb and say, is really terrible.
