Adam Sandler has made it no secret that he enjoys working with his friends and family. His latest film, Happy Gilmore 2, is stuffed to the gills with cameos and friends of the actor. His wife, Jackie Sandler, and daughters, Sadie and Sunny, also have roles in the comedy sequel. The original, directed by Dennis Dugan, came out in 1996, and the sequel attempts a bit of maturity. Sandler's Happy is now the one trying to save the traditions of the sport he picked up on a whim. However, the film begins on a downer from which it never recovers. The sequel becomes a much darker comedy as Happy is now a widower raising four strapping young men and a daughter, Vienna (Sunny Sandler). His old rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) is in a mental asylum, and an upstart millionaire named Frank Manatee (Benny Safdie) wants to start a rival golf league that goes against all the rules. Happy is now a depressed alcoholic and wouldn't give Frank the time of day, except he really needs the money for Vienna's dance school fees. Can he turn it around in a winner-takes-it-all tournament to save the sport?
