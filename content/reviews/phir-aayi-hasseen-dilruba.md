Released a little over three years ago, the original Haseen Dillruba was tonally all over the place. It tried to take on at least three genres—crime noir, cringe comedy, and nineties Bollywood romance—and swung between them wildly. In the process, it made calamitous errors and ended up getting very little right. The sequel, Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba, seems to be aware of its predecessor’s mistakes. That likely explains why it sticks to one lane and doesn’t deviate too far from it. Alas, knowing why you have failed can only get you so far. You still need to know how to fix it. With Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba, the execution is as shoddy if not worse. The Netflix film seems to have zero understanding of cohesion and film structure.
