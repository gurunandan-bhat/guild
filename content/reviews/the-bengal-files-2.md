Sequences that stun and performances that force a watch: The humiliation of CBI officer Shiva Pandit (Darshan Kumar) in Husseini House, on the orders of a weak-kneed senior (Puneet Issar). Contrast it with an earlier Zanjeer moment when Shiva crisply tells off Husseini’s goon that he hasn’t been given permission to sit. The dining table cool of criminal Sardar Husseini (Saswata Chatterjee) with elegant wife (Madalsa Sharma) playing gracious hostess, the underlying menace palpable. The goonga pagal (Mithun Chakraborty) as his story seeps out, a piercing moment when he helplessly tells Shiva that he can’t talk. Tongue cut off, castrated, yet the fire burns The public lynching of Gandhian Judge Banerjee (Priyanshu Chatterjee) even as he defines equality and justice while Ghulam (Namashi Chakraborty) kicks on mercilessly. The undying spirit of Chaudhry Kaku (Dibyendu Bhattacharya) in his guillotine moment at Noakhali when Ghulam demands, “Bol, Pakistan zindabad”.
