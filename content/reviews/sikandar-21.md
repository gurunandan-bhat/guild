'Welcome to hell,' says Salman Khan somewhere at the beginning of Sikandar. It doesn't take you long to realise he was warning you about his own film. Salman, set to turn 60 this December, was never much of an actor (I use 'much' with much politeness). Except, perhaps, for few and far between flashes of some sort of emoting — and emotion — in films like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Tere Naam, and a fistful of others. The last film he truly 'acted' in was Kabir Khan's Bajrangi Bhaijaan, and that was 10 years ago. In the last couple of outings (see box), the indifference has been evident, with directors employing everything from miraculous computer graphics to superhuman editing skills to simply ensure that Salman is a living presence on screen. In Sikandar, Salman's disinterest has peaked, and in a directly proportional manner, so has our disillusionment.
