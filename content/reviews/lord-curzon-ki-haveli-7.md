Anshuman Jha's Lord Curzon Ki Haveli is the kind of film that says a lot about how it was made. This, of course, is conjecture, but hear me out: a group of actors have met for a weekly hang. Conversations soon segue into discussions about mainstream cinema and how disappointing things have been. Outside, the sun has set, and inside, the room is filled with a haze of smoke and moody yellow lighting. Posters of Alfred Hitchcock and Satyajit Ray adorn the wall; the bookshelf in the corner has a section dedicated to plays by Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett. Emboldened by fluids, one of them suggests a radical departure. He will make a film that will show others how it is done. The rest, equally fortified, chime in: yes. Iâ€™d like to believe that better sense has prevailed since then, but it was too late to back out. The result is Lord Curzon Ki Haveli
