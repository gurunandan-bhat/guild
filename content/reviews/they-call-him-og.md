“When a cyclone strikes, bow down to the tide. When OG arrives, run and hide.” A character holding a grudge against the protagonist says something to this effect. It isn’t the sharpest mass dialogue in mainstream Telugu cinema, but the actor’s intonation gives it weight. Director Sujeeth’s They Call Him OG references cyclones a few times, but fire serves as the recurring visual motif, shaping the presence of the titular character — Ojas Gambheera, aka Original Gangster, played by Pawan Kalyan. The film was in production for four years, and the director openly acknowledges his admiration for the star, filling the film with fan-service moments.
