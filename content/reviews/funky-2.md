Naaku galeej anipisthundhi, which translates to "It's all too awkward," is a repetitive phrase in KV Anudeep's third film, Funky. After two hours and eight minutes, it’s this thought – and the only one – that you are left with. Director KV Anudeep’s unique sense of humour may not be everyone’s cup of tea. In three films, he’s made that loud and clear. But there’s a sense of earnestness and honesty in Jathi Ratnalu and Prince that hardly makes you look away. You'd want to know what new trick he has up his sleeve the third time around.
