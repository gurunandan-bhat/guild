Vyas is a teacher at the same school where his wife, Bhagyalakshmi, is the principal. Their son Ram struggles with his grades and resists rote learning. Vyas’s innovative teaching methods draw attention from his son and students alike, leading to remarkable progress. Meanwhile, his marriage begins to suffer, and in a cruel twist of fate, his future hangs in the balance, leaving him to face an uncertain path. Kajal Chaudhary makes a decent impression despite her one-note role. The young child actor Viharsh Yadavalli impresses, while Rakesh Rachakonda convincingly brings his character to life. Anu Haasan also shines in a brief yet sparkling cameo. Srinivas Avasarala, however, feels underutilised, while BVS Ravi, Shiva Kandukuri don’t get enough screen time to make much impact.
