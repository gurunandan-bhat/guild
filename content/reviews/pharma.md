Nivin Pauly delivered the only and greatest comeback of the week. A character in the film calls him the Comeback King and by the end of the show, you realise why. Pharma, being his foray into the OTT space, brought back memories of the films that the actor nailed in the past. While the past few years have seen fewer films and fewer hits, it feels like a huge relief to see him having so much control over his craft in PR Arun’s Pharma. The eight-episode series, streaming on JioHotstar, is a delightful thriller, though with minor shortcomings.
