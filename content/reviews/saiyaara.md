Saiyaara is proof that Hindi mainstream cinema hasn't (yet) forgotten to make a film that tugs at the heart, and more importantly, quietly but firmly makes its place in it. Bringing back old-school romance with a modern vibe, Saiyaara may seem Aashiqui 2-coded in parts, but has enough feel and fire to power its way to blockbuster box office... one which has been missing a raw, real and relatable love story for a while. Directed by Mohit Suri — the man who has earned enough cred in spinning love stories that meld a beating heart and deeply-felt humanity with searing chemistry and chartbuster melody — Saiyaara introduces two new faces as its leads. But in an age where a performance on a Friday rarely makes a career soar or stumble anymore — determined as it is by social media heft, paparazzi pull and networking skills — Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda prove that they are in it for the long haul. If what they have delivered in their debut film is anything to go by, two new actors with promise and passion, skill and sincerity are born. The stardom that they will invariably achieve after this film will be but a byproduct of the hard work they have put in.
