It all comes down to this! The Netflix series, Stranger Things, ends with a big bang and lots of emotional moments with the last episode titled The Rightside Up. Co-creators Matt and Ross Duffer must wind down the story of Hawkins, Indiana, and its residents, who were terrorised by the Upside Down for the past five seasons. Now, they must vanquish the big villain and make it out alive. The result is a satisfying but expected ending that is sure to leave fans discussing it for years to come.
