There's a lot of suspension of belief and logic in Jewel Thief: The Heist Begins. A master jewel thief goes so under the radar that the authorities can never quite catch him. And then there's the actual heist which tries to pull the wool over audiences' eyes over and over again. Produced by filmmaker Siddharth Anand, the Netflix thriller sets up a predictable narrative with familiar characters. Rehan Roy (Saif Ali Khan) is the world's best jewel thief in exile after his father disowns him. But a blackmail scheme from art collector Rajan Aulakh (Jaideep Ahlawat) draws him back to India, where he could be arrested at any moment. The impossible mission he has been recruited for is to steal Africa's Kohinoor, the Red Sun diamond, valued at over Rs 500 crore. Rehan and Rajan must work together and try not to kill each other before the heist is completed. The feature also adds in a complicated romance angle with the introduction of Farrah (Nikita Dutta), Rajan's wife.
