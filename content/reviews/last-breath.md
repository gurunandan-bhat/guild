A low-frills survival thriller with the drama ratcheted up to a level optimum enough to keep audiences on the edge of their seats is hard to come by. Last Breath gets quite a bit of that tricky formula right, even as it serves up an astounding story of resilience based on a true account. Directed by Alex Parkinson and released in select markets earlier this year, Last Breath is a feature film remake of the 2019 documentary that Parkinson co-directed with Richard da Costa. It follows the remarkable real-life story of a group of deep-sea divers who race against time to rescue a stranded teammate after an accident.
