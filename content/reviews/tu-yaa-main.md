It has its origins in the Thai thriller The Pool (2018) but writers Himanshu Sharma and Abhishek Bandekar give it a vibe that’s completely Mumbai when content creators from two ends of society meet for an “epic collab”. Director Bejoy Nambiar flags off with an effective beginning that has a woman teasing two men. The flavour: distinctly Maharashtrian. The introduction: deadly, as a crocodile makes its quick and early entry.
