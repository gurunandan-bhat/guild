Raj Kapoor's daughter Rima Jain proclaims in Dining with the Kapoors, "The entire Kapoor family is a dramatic family." Several generations of India's famous film family come together to celebrate their roots, especially Raj and his wife, Krishna Raj Kapoor. The hour-long special brings cousins, siblings, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews and in-laws together for a chaotic but candid ode to family and the bonds that endure. Directed by Smriti Mundhra and created by Armaan Jain, Dining with the Kapoors is not a deep dive into family history but instead a snapshot into some of their traditions.
