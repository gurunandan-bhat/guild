After a notorious serial killer, Carl Bhojraj, escapes from Tihar Jail, Mumbai cop Zende, who had previously caught him 15 years ago, is tasked to find him again. With a small team, Zende pursues the elusive criminal across cities, using his instincts and old-school policing to track him down. The cat-and-mouse chase culminates in Goa, where the team uses their wits to capture Carl. Inspector Zende puts Manoj Bajpayee in a similar spot as The Family Man – a duty-bound officer, alternating between familial priorities and work, but with stronger moral support. He lends delicate, subtle comedy touches to the role and also shows Zende’s firmness about his stance, both at home and at duty. The balance that Bajpayee brings to the part is indeed one of the film’s sweeter spots.
