Kill might be one of the rare movies that actually benefit from a remake—that’s how royally it fumbles both its action and revenge plot. We discuss the film’s indecipherable approach to close combat, the lead actor Lakshya’s wooden performance, and the lack of inventiveness in the story. We also talk about the unearned John Wick and The Raid comparisons, and wonder why international audiences seemed to appreciate the film.
