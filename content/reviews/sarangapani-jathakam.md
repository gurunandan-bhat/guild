Oscar Wilde’s semi-comic tale Lord Arthur Savile’s Crime, published in 1891, follows an aristocrat’s absurd efforts to commit a murder before marrying his fiancée — purely because a palm reader foretells it as his destiny. Writer-director Mohanakrishna Indraganti reimagines this premise within the framework of a contemporary Telugu household, weaving in sharp social commentary, reflections on the film industry and social media culture, while also tipping his hat to the comedic sensibilities of Telugu and Tamil cinema greats like Jandhyala and ‘Crazy’ Mohan. It may sound like a lot to pack in — but Sarangapani Jathakam is a surprisingly smooth blend of social satire and screwball comedy, anchored by an excellent cast, particularly Priyadarshi Pulikonda and Vennela Kishore.
