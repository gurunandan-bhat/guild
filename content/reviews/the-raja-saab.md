Prabhas's much-anticipated film, The Raja Saab is about a search for a missing grandfather. Over its three-hour runtime, viewers also end up searching for more than a grandfather. They seek plot cohesion, character depth, genuine scares, or consistent entertainment value - must-haves for every film. Like the film's protagonist wandering through a haunted palace, you may feel a lack of clear direction or a fully satisfying destination. The Raja Saab begins with Raja (Prabhas) living with his grandmother Gangamma, played by Zarina Wahab. Gangamma suffers from Alzheimer's and remembers only her missing husband Kanakaraju (Sanjay Dutt) and her grandson. She tells Raja to keep looking for his missing grandfather, who often appears in her dreams.
