Babloo Nishaanchi (Aaishvary Thackeray) is at the end of his rope. Recently released from prison, after a ten-year stint, he finds himself in freefall. A belated discovery about his twin brother and the woman he loved most sends him over the edge. Babloo fumes drunkenly by a pond. He screams into the void. Funnily, the void screams back — there's a random man on the opposite embankment, mimicking and mocking our hero's exertions. This scene has the Anurag Kashyap touch: impotent rage and self-pity undercut by absurdist humour.
