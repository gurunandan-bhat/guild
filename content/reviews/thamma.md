With director Aditya Sarpotdar (of Munjya fame) at the helm and proven names Dinesh Vijan and Amar Kaushik in the credits as producers, a rib-tickling horror thriller is the big expectation. This time, they also mix in romance and smooches. Between Taadka (Rashmika Mandanna), a fang-bearing betaal (vampire) who rescues smooth-talking, adventure-seeking, reel-making journo Alok Goyal (Ayushmann Khurrana) from a bear in the jungle. Dil ki dhadkan as a synonym for love is tossed out as pyaar conquers all even when the heart has stopped ticking.
