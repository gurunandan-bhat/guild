Kanaka Mahalakshmi a.k.a Kanakam, a feisty young woman, is deputed as a constable in Repalle in the 90s. While her male colleagues consistently undermine her capabilities, she finds an ally in a senior cop Sambasiva. Kanakam forges a strong bond with a folk artiste Chandrika, who goes missing. As the missing cases mount in the village, she goes all out to find answers. Varsha Bollamma effortlessly portrays the psychological evolution of Kanakam through the series, from an underdog staffer to an officer who’ll go to any length to seek the truth. She has an arresting screen presence, displaying an uncanny ability to hold a show on her shoulders. Srinivas Avasarala’s penchant for unconventional roles takes an interesting turn, and he responds well to it.
