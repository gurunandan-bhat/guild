Biopics are volatile beasts. Too deferential, and they end up mummifying their subjects in sepia-toned sainthood. Too irreverent, and they trivialise a life that originally clawed tooth and nail for attention. Songs of Paradise, Prime Video’s ode to Kashmir’s first female playback singer Raj Begum (fictionalised here as Zeba/Noor Begum), navigates this tightrope with unexpected ease. Let’s dive into Songs of Paradise story and ending, which are both explained here. What starts as the aspiration of a young Kashmiri girl in the 1950s (with the courage to sing when women were instructed to keep silent) in this Danish Renzu movie is, by the end, a generational echo. The flames which engulfed her recordings become the flames that illuminate the way for her granddaughter. The past is not lost as long as someone is still humming its melody.
