The title is a put-off, sounding like a stuck record. When it takes off with the glossy visuals expected from Dharma Productions, the scene’s set for fun, flirting, a helping of calibrated humour. But back-to-back songs in Croatia, shot like a travelogue, begin to discomfortingly resemble a tourist pamphlet. The he’s-so-annoying hero who has the heroine’s lips curled with irritation, is so textbook Hum Tum (2004) that ho-ho, how funny, slips into ho-hum, how silly.
