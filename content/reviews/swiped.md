Swiped recounts the history of the dating app explosion of the 2010s, which was led by Tinder and followed by Bumble. Whitney Wolfe Herd was at the center of both, and the Hulu film explores her journey from someone who started out wanting to make a difference with charitable work to the woman who ended up changing the face of dating. The biopic benefits from having the likeable Lily James star in this average retelling of the rise of startup culture, which only dips into the more controversial points. Swiped follows Whitney (James) as she goes from a 24-year-old marketing director to the CEO of Bumble/Badoo at 31. The film shows the early days of Tinder and how it evolved into the biggest dating app on the scene. Whitney had a big hand in its success, but it is her word against the founders, who block her out of the company. She picks up the pieces to start her own app, Bumble, which puts the safety of women above all.
