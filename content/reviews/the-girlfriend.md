The Girlfriend is a film for the ages. Had it been made a decade or two ago, it would have felt just as relevant, and if revisited decades later, it would still hold true. Its layered exploration of men, women, and the childhood experiences that shape their adult relationships is timeless. Writer and director Rahul Ravindran crafts a slow-burn drama that cuts close to the bone — close enough to make us pause and reflect on our emotional maturity and approach to love.
