Directed and co-written by Gopichand Malineni, the film is a mass entertainer that caters to certain audiences. It isn't for the everyday cinema fans, but it is enjoyable to the masses. Sunny Deol is pretty much himself in a film that is entirely set in the south, with major tones and vibes from the regional cinema. The writing and direction aren't anything new or different from other Tamil or Telugu superstar-based films in recent years. The only difference is Sunny Deol and his war cry. The film begins with a bloodied letter reaching the president of India asking for help after their village has been raided by a terrorist who runs an organised crime syndicate in and around 30 villages. The letter by a young girl as the president in tears, as it arrives with 10 thumbs of her brothers from the village. The letter promises that if they can't find help, the next time a box of severed heads will reach the Rashtrapati Bhavan.
