Can a man become a single parent in India? The odds are stacked against him in the Netflix series Single Papa. Kunal Kemmu plays the man in question, a divorced man who finds purpose in becoming a father to a baby abandoned in his car. The zany comedy, created by Neeraj Udhwani and Ishita Moitra, has an equally zany cast of characters in this slightly fantasy path to adoption. Even while the scenarios grow wild, the heart of Single Papa is sincere as it bats for gender equality and supports adoption.
