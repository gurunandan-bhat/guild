There are true-crime documentaries â€” and then there is Amy Bradley is Missing. The three-episode watch chronicles a missing person story which is equal parts horrific and heartbreaking, appalling and astounding. Most users on Netflix, where the documentary series is trending in the Top 10 in many countries, have used a standout term to describe it: 'gobsmacking'. Which is what it exactly is, and then some more. This is a 'missing person' case which has lasted 27 years, and with no closure for Amy's parents and her brother. Still, they have decided to never give up hope, and more importantly, never cease trying. Bringing into focus the ephemeral nature of life and the fact that anything can go south any moment, Amy Bradley is Missing is about a family torn asunder when what was meant to be a fun-filled luxury vacation on a cruise goes completely wrong. On board, with roughly a few thousand other vacationers, was Amy, a vivacious 23-year-old just days away from a new job, along with her parents and younger brother Brad.
