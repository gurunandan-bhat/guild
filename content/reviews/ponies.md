Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke and The White Lotus's Haley Lu Richardson team up as two American women bound by the same fate in an unknown country. The dramedy Ponies, created by Susanna Fogel and David Iserson, has the two women who are opposites in every way become undercover CIA operatives to solve a personal case. While the situations the two find themselves in grow increasingly wild and unbelievable, the actresses manage to carve space within the story for their characters to stand out. The title Ponies stands for 'Persons of No Interest' in intelligence terms.
