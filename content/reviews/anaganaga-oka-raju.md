Two years after the urban romcom Miss Shetty Mr Polishetty(2023), actor-screenwriter Naveen Polishetty returns with another film laced with humour. In contrast to the restraint he showed in that film, Naveen unabashedly plays to the gallery in Anaganaga Oka Raju. The humour is delivered through gags that come at such a rapid pace that the audience may not get a breather to pause and reflect.
