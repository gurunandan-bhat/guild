Directed by Sharan Art and starring Tarsem Jassar, Gurpreet Ghuggi, Mark Bennington; Guru Nanak Jahaz is a historical drama that revisits an almost forgotten moment to remind us of the struggles of early migrants to Canada. While Amrinder Gillâ€™s directorial debut, Chhalla Mud Ke Nahi Aaya (2022) examined the many hurdles faced by the first wave of immigrants to Canada, this film examines the many struggles with government policies and the resilience of migrants in the face of it.
