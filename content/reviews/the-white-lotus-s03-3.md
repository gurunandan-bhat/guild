White Lotus is back with its signature theme – vacation gone awry. Unlikeable rich tourists and their penchant for seeking trouble head to a luxurious resort in Thailand and what unfolds is anything but relaxing. The 3rd instalment follows the series’ template in theme and storytelling. Nothing changes there as it stays true thematically to the previous seasons, but it puts the brakes on the pace a bit. Like its predecessors, this too begins with a mysterious crime and an air of suspicion looms in days that lead up to it. What also stays constant is the eccentricity, dark secrets and debauchery of the rich guests, whose biggest fear is poverty. There is also an amusing yet shocking sexcapade involving incest.
