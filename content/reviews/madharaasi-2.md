Sivakarthikeyan, despite being one of the celebrated mainstream heroes in the Tamil film industry, continues to surprise everyone with his script choices. His last few films, while fitting into the commercial tropes, have also stood out for their storytelling. Will ‘Madharaasi’, his latest collaboration with director AR Murugadoss, add to his success streak? Let’s find out! Raghuram (Sivakarthikeyan) is an orphan with a traumatic past. While battling delusion syndrome, love strikes him. As Malathi (Rukmini Vasanth) enters his life, he changes for good. Meanwhile, NIA officer Prem (Biju Menon) and his team are on a mission to stop a notorious North Indian gang involved in a weapon smuggling syndicate. Virat (Vidyut Jammwal) and Chirag (Shabbir Kallarkal) are leading the syndicate’s plan to smuggle arms into Tamil Nadu. Prem’s failed mission and Raghu’s unsuccessful suicide attempt bring them together. Prem hatches a plan to stop the arms from entering the state. Raghuram gets entangled in this mission. Will he be helpful to Prem? Will Raghuram and Malathi end up together? What happens to Virat and Chirag’s mission? All these and more are answered over the course of two hours and 48 minutes.
