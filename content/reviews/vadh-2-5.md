Vadh (2022) came without much fanfare, yet the narrative of a couple battling their circumstances gradually gained recognition as a thriller. Vadh 2 serves as a spiritual sequel to the original film, featuring the same characters, although the storyline is entirely independent of its predecessor. With a runtime of just over 2 hours, the film's length is reasonable; but even that becomes an uphill task because of the bland screenplay that relies heavily on the final ‘twist’.
