In the throes of death, Don Patel (Aamir Khan) of Goa has a hilarious end with maid Sakhubai also breathing her last, discussing mopping, cleaning and unwashed utensils. Two British agents take back with them Sakhubai’s infant and bring him up as Happy (Vir Das), the wiz chef who makes the yummiest sandwiches in the world. In Goa, the don’s daughter Mama (Mona Singh), his evil inheritor, is a super chef too. Her special cutlets (poisoned for victims) and her good work cutlets (a reward for her boys), ready to be served. Mama’s also in the fairness and beauty business, a little jibe at Indian prejudice against dark skin. IMUMI is a brand – it’s a giggle. There are intercuts with the eternally charming Sanjeev Kapoor and his ‘salt to taste’ tip, all quite wacky.
