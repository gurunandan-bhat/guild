One might not expect that a film released in 1997, centered around a giant snake, would spawn four sequels and a Mandarin version that premiered earlier this year. Anaconda was a light-hearted and entertaining film that captivated audiences at the time. Some films and all snakes should be left alone – Anaconda is certainly one of them- the film and snake, both.
