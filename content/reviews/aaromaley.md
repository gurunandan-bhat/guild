'Aaromaley' arrives at a time when Tamil cinema desperately needs light, feel-good romantic dramas. Directed by Sarang Thiagu and starring Kishen Das, Shivathmika Rajashekar, and Harshath Khan, this warm romantic entertainer offers genuine laughs and authentic moments that mirror real-life relationships. It carves out space for itself by focusing not on larger-than-life heroes, but on ordinary people navigating honest feelings.
