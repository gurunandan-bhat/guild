Aap Jaisa Koi is what happens when Badrinath Ki Dulhania (2017), Vicky Donor (2012), 2 States (2014) and Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani (2023) have an awkward college reunion at a restaurant only for everyone to leave without paying the bill. The rest of the gang — Dream Girl (2019), Meenakshi Sundareshwar (2021) and Mrs. (2025) — arrive very late, so the restaurant manager detains them instead. Aap Jaisa Koi is also what happens when playful Bollywood fare is strained through the streaming algorithm. There’s a functionality about the film that flattens the big-screen fluidity of romance, (in)compatibility, warring families and dramatic sermons. Beyond the performative premise of a small-minded man courting a free-thinking woman, the cross-cultural romcom fails to retain the wit, narrative scale and acting sparkle that mark this genre.
