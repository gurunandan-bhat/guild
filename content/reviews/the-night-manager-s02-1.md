After 10 years, Tom Hiddleston is back in The Night Manager for a second season. Much time has passed since we last saw the character Jonathan Pine, but the spy world continues to have its shadowy figures ready to plunge civilization into darkness. Now, as a more seasoned intelligence agent, Pine tries to chase his past to stop another coup. The British spy thriller, created by David Farr, has a new urgency and even more dangerous criminal in its return on Amazon Prime Video.
