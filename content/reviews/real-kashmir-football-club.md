The emergence of a professional football club is the unlikely "underdog success" story of Real Kashmir Football Club. The SonyLIV series, directed by Mahesh Mathai and Rajesh Mapuskar, highlights the passion of two men who try to get the club off the ground and change the future of Kashmiri youth. The well-meaning series hits all the right notes of a sports drama while incorporating the real-life obstacles of fronting a professional football club. The story of hope and courage is inspirational.
