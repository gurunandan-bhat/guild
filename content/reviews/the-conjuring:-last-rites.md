The Conjuring: Last Rites is the final release in the hit horror film franchise that debuted in 2013 with The Conjuring. The films explored stories of real-life couple Ed Warren and his wife Lorraine Warren, who were pioneers in the supernatural community back when their findings were often mocked by the scientific community. The final film in the franchise explores a very different and dramatic tone while also bringing back some classic filmmaking techniques of the franchise. The film has more drama than expected, but the last act picks up the pace enough for a good send-off. The film begins in 1864 as young Ed and Lorraine have begun taking new cases while expecting their baby, Judy. The first encounter with this demon puts their baby at risk, and they decide to never return to the case, but years later, after Judy has grown up, it shows up at another house among the Smurl family. However, after Ed suffers due to health complications, the Warrnes decide to stay away from the field and stick to sharing their knowledge through teaching.
