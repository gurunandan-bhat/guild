In appearance, premise, and pretty-people-packaging, Param Sundari is perhaps the most Dharma Productions-iest looking film of the year — except it comes from Maddock Films. I stepped into the familiar, formulaic love story half-expecting a quintessentially Maddock “high-concept hook.” Surely it can’t be as simple as 'Delhi boy travels to Kerala to fall in love with a Malayali girl'? Surely there must be a time-travel angle? Perhaps Janhvi Kapoor’s character is reincarnated? Sidharth Malhotra must be a ghost, right? Except nope, it’s exactly what it appears to be — a by-the-book, clash-of-cultures, fish-out-of-water love story. Param (a sauceless Sidharth Malhotra doing his best decaf Rocky Randhawa impression) is the spoiled, entitled son of a Delhi industrialist (the always-enjoyable Sanjay Kapoor). Param spends his time as a tech investor and wants to back an experimental new dating app that claims to go beyond the usual suspects and use a person’s “energy and frequency” to find their one true soulmate.
