Given the high benchmark it has to reckon with, Delhi Crime Season 3 has its task cut out. It does all it can to measure up but falls just a tad, (yes, just a tad!), short of replicating the powerful wallop that the first two seasons packed. The thrilling and disquieting true-crime drama is not the sort of gut punch that would send one reeling, nor is the nature of the violence that it depicts as terrifyingly severe as it was the last time around. Much of the brutality on show - the victims are teenage girls captured by a gang of vicious traffickers - is either only suggested or palpably curbed rather than shown in graphic detail.
