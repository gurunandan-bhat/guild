Planes, trains, and automobiles. If there is a third season of Hijack, a car seems the most likely scenario. Until then, the series has relocated to snowy, cold Berlin for its second season. Idris Elba stars as the unlucky Sam Nelson, who finds himself in another life-or-death situation after the Flight KA29 hijacking. Created by George Kay and Jim Field Smith, the Apple TV series gives Sam Nelson a personal reason to be invested in this latest hijack. The eight-episode series cannot sustain the tension as it introduces new obstacles for Sam to face.
