The centipede is a multi-legged, predatory anthropod. Writer-director Chandan Arora substitutes Israeli title Magpie (prisoner-turned-police informant) with the Hindi word for centipede to narrate an Indianised version of the drama series. Set in Goa, Ashu Gaonkar (Roshan Mathew) is the bechara of the party where he’s out of jail after serving a sentence for murder while older brother Max (Mohit Raina with dimples) is well settled with pretty wife Nisha (Sarah Jane Dias), daughter Ira (Kurangi Vijayshri Nagraj) and friends-turned-colleagues Shardul (Mahesh Shetty) and Pedro (Ninad Kamat). Max and co have just landed the biggest construction contract of their lives which will change the landscape of Goa. Ashu weakly attempts to re-enter their lives but Max shuts the door on him. Here’s some money, stay out, lead your own life. Before you can begin to feel sorry for Ashu, his twisted, manipulative mind which is not beyond sudden spurts of violence, gives him a dangerous dimension. Using his seeming innocence to prise a confession or two from prime suspects is DSP Leena Naik (Heeba Shah).
