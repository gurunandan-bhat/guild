One is unsure if it’s even ethical to call Good Bad Ugly a feature film. From a safe distance, one can argue that it’s the length of a regular movie and it also features a major movie star in the lead. If you want to push it, one may even argue that it has a something resembling a plot and a screenplay that holds characters and plot points in place. But if you’re willing to wake up and accept reality, you’ll soon realise that Good Bad Ugly is just the Instagram Reels homepage of Ajith’s most obsessive fanboy. Directed by Adhik Ravichandran, the film doesn’t even try to worry about delicately breaking the fourth wall; this Ajith fanboy ends up shooting so many references from the star's filmography at us, that he nukes the fourth wall and builds a grand tomb over it.
