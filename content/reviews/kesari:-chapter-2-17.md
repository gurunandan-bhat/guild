Directed and co-written by Karan Singh Tyagi, the film is based on a book titled The Case That Shook The Empire by Raghu Palat and Pushpa Palat. Led by Akshay Kumar, Ananya Pandey and R Madhavan, the makers ultimately finally find a rightful place and intensity for all the actors on screen. Even the supporting cast has a command on the audience like never before. The makers do not have to force an emotional reaction out the audience, as the story and its characters do it for them. Not only do we get a real glimpse of the massacre but also understand the sheer magnitude of it with the post credits rolling the names of the martyrs in tiny font because the space isn't enough to fill them all in.
