There was a time when the bad guys in Bollywood used to be mainly smugglers. Remember that word sardonically mouthed by the lanky Anthony Gonsalves? ‘Biscuit’, he says, in an iconic Amar Akbar Anthony scene, and we see exactly what he’s referring to: a briefcase filled with shiny gold ‘biscuits’. That was back in the restrictive 70s, when everything had to be smuggled in. Post-liberalisation, with foreign exchange freely available and international travel becoming easier, villainy shifted to other spheres. Or at least that’s what the movies showed us.
