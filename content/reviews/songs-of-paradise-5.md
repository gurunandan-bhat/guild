Songs of Paradise is a film based on the life and journey of Padma Shri awardee Raj Begum, the first female singer of Radio Kashmir. The story follows Noor Begum (name changed) who defies societal norms to pursue her passion for music. It is a tale of her resilience and the struggles she faced to break free from the shackles of a conservative society to become a celebrated artist. With a solid lineup, but none of the familiar faces deliver any meaningful performances. Soni Razdan’s presence barely captures the aura of a legendary singer. Saba Azad looks mostly confused and struggles to embody the character’s rebellious spirit. Sheeba Chaddha is one of the major disappointments, saddled with a one-dimensional and unsubstantial role.
