Almost half an hour into director Pandiraaj’s ‘Thalaivan Thalaivii’, Nithya Menen’s Perarasi receives a phone call from her husband Aagasaveeran (Vijay Sethupathi). Her phone displays his name as ‘Kirukku Payya’, which loosely translates to 'mad or crazy man'. This name is not just perfect for Aagasveeran, but for every single person in the world of director Pandiraaj’s ‘Thalaivan Thalaivii’. Set in Madurai, ‘Thalaivan Thalaivii’ begins with Perarasi, along with her parents, performing a tonsuring ritual at a temple for her daughter, but without her husband Aagasaveeran. The couple has been living separately for three months, and we soon learn that Perarasi is seeking a divorce. As their families get involved, and after hundreds of ear-splitting arguments, it becomes clear that Aagasveeran and Perarasi are two crazy, indecisive people who are stuck with each other.
