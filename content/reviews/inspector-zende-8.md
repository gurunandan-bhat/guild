Bikini Killer Charles Sobhraj, as he was gleefully dubbed by the tabloid press because many of his early hippie-trail victims were attired thus, never goes out of vogue. Just when you think there can’t be yet another iteration of his life and amazingly criminal times, up he pops again. Earlier this year, we had his character appear in a web-series (Black Warrant) ensemble; now he’s sharing equal space in a feature based on the exploits of real-life cop Madhukar Bapurao Zende who nabbed the dreaded criminal from Goa’s famed O Coqueiro restaurant. This is not myth, as many spin-off Sobhraj stories inevitably were; it is fact, causing the eatery to become a local landmark.
