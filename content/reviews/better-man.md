Better Man is a strange but effective musical biopic on singer Robbie Williams, formerly of Take That. Viewers see him lay bare several key moments from life - the good, the bad and the ugly. However, until the credits roll, we never see his face. That's because the role of Robbie is taken over by a CGI chimpanzee (performed by Jonno Davies). Robbie narrates his story and the Michael Gracey film shows how fame can be both the best and worst thing to happen to you. As far as biopics go, this feature makes an impact from the very first scene. The biopic charts Robbie's incredible rise from a nobody living in Stoke-on-Trent to becoming the UK's best-selling solo artist ever. It's a steep rise that comes with its own perils as the teenage Robert becomes Robbie and begins to lose himself to his starry career. Seeking the approval of his absent dad, he manages to become one of the greats while overcoming several addictions from drugs, booze and dizzying heights of fame. This is a happy story, as we know he does emerge out of the dark side, but the movie never shies away from the bleakness.
