When Avatar (2009) came 16 years ago, it broke new ground on many fronts, especially with the visual effects. Although it took some time for the sequel, The Way of Water (2022), to arrive, but because the story was set in a familiar world and technology had advanced sufficiently by then, it didn’t have the same appeal as the original.
