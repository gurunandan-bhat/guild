Ashu is released from prison after 14 years for a murder in which he was possibly framed. He aims to exact revenge against his indifferent, wealthy brother Max and his pals Shardul and Pedro, the prime reasons behind his jail stint. He cunningly infiltrates Max’s life and real estate business, juggling police obligations with a personal vendetta. Who has the last laugh in this sibling rivalry? Roshan Mathew’s decision to chase greener pastures in Hindi cinema, apart from Malayalam, is yielding impressive results. He sinks his teeth into the portrayal of Ashu, a socially awkward younger brother whose trauma fuels his bitterness. Mohit Raina, pitted against Roshan’s Ashu, has a relatively straightforward character arc but lends the necessary snobbishness to his portrayal.
