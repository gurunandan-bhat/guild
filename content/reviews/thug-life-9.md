The first half of Thug Life has something that recent Tamil gangster dramas don’t: drama. The film begins in 1995 in Old Delhi with a supposed peace talk between two gangs in a crowded and bustling old building. On one hand, we have Rangaraya Saktivel (Kamal Haasan) and his gang, on the other, Sadanand (Mahesh Manjrekar), who has set his enemies up. The police force close in and amidst all this tension, a father, his son, and daughter go about delivering dailies to each door. The exchanges between the characters are natural and subtle, and we get a smart, de-aged Kamal Haasan. He doesn’t get a raging introduction scene. Anything and everything is for the scene and the tension, which ends in the poor father getting shot as collateral damage and Sakthivel walking away carrying the orphaned boy Amar (Silambarasan TR) as his ‘shield’ from the police bullets. This straightforward, simple, but effective storytelling makes the first half of Thug Life an engrossing watch, and it undoes everything it achieves in the second.
