A year and a half later, we pick up back where Canada returned Kaala left viewers after being arrested in the Season 1 finale. Paramvir Singh Cheema’s Kaala has new innings and a new mission to accomplish in this musical revenge saga. While certain narratives from Season 1 move forward, others take you back as the series adds more unnecessary drama to the proceedings. The SonyLIV series, Chamak-The Conclusion, suffers from wanting to do too much but not knowing where to trim down the sprawling saga. Unpredictable singer Kaala (Cheema) reconciles with music label owner Pratap Singh Deol (Manoj Pahwa) after it is revealed he is Tara Singh’s (Gippy Grewal) son. As they prepare to take Teeja Sur to newer heights, internal conflicts and past histories threaten to derail everything. By the end of the six episodes, mostly all the characters have a rise and fall, not all of them satisfactory.
