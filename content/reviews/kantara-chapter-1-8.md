In 2022, when Rishab Shetty’s ‘Kantara’ hit the screens, the breath of fresh air wrapped in originality and ingenuity swept not just his home state Karnataka but the country at large like a storm. Three years later, as the prequel, once again an amalgamation of folklore, rituals and the ancient Indian belief system rooted in Kannada culture, makes its tryst with big screens, it’s a tornado. Only, it will sweep you off your feet for all the right reasons. Call it a cinematic marvel, an ethereal experience, masterclass in how not to get a franchise wrong, ‘Kantara’s’ prequel reinforces how legends are born. Shetty, writer-director and lead actor, proves resoundingly how ‘Kantara’ was no fluke, only a flash of the multitalented genius that he is. Shetty ups the game in all aspects. Story-telling with writing support from Anirudh Mahesh and Shanil Guru, world building or treatment, he does not falter in any department.
