She was one of eight writers from around the world to partake in intensive workshops and networking opportunities aimed at elevating her craft. She was also among the 34 members of the press selected to cover the Sundance Film Festival as part of the Press Inclusion initiative—an effort by the festival to support critics from underrepresented groups through financial and systematic assistance.
